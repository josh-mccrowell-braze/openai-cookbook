Tips Appreciated         Templates People's Champion      People’s Champion  In the cold, gray world where the corporations have won, the Union of Unions stands strong as a beacon of hope. Sure, it has its problems, but at least you are Free, unlike the poor souls trapped in the Libertarian hellscape. You must go forth, and bring hope to the masses. For each template gain +1 Save against Fear. Starting Equipment: Leather_Jacket(light, 2), AK-47 (mr, 2d4, 6, Dmg_Cascade), Communist Manifesto Starting Skills: 1) Farming 2) Engines 3) Firearms A. Inspiration, Turn Bourgeoisie  B. Internationale  C. Neither Gods Nor Caesars  D. Nothing to Lose But Your Chains  Inspiration The Champion doesn’t get this ability, so much as the team gets the ability. This is a pool of points equal to 1 per People’s Champion template in the team, and usable on various things (listed below) by anyone on the team. To activate, the player using the point must inspire the target in some way. I’m primarily picturing a short uplifting speech, but if you can figure another way, I ain’t gonna stop you. Ways to refill the pool are also listed below. Uses:  Restore 1d6 HP to the target Give a +4 to a single test or save. (Traditional assisting only provides +2)  Restoration:  Champion successfully assists someone Champion takes time to repair gear rather than simply purchase new item Champion shows solidarity with the common man at a detriment to themselves.  Turn Bourgeoisie When confronted by the Bourgeoisie or one of their dogs (CEOs, cops), you may speak words of revolution (and spend a Conviction point), then roll 2d6, consulting the chart below. If you roll under the number (meet is beat) the target is turned. A “T” means the target is automatically turned, “D” means the target is destroyed, and “-“ means automatic failure. In cases of dual numbers (ex 11/5), the first number is for turned, the second is for destroyed. Turned targets flee the area for 1d6 rounds. Destroyed targets leave the area for good and rethink the choices they made that lead them to this point.  Internationale When meeting members of the Proletariat, reaction rolls are made at a +4. Neither Gods Nor Caesars Adjacent allies may use your Save vs Fear in replace of their own. Nothing to Lose But Your Chains Once per session, by giving a grandstanding, uplifting speech, you can give a free Command (as per the traditional spell) to the audience with no Save.   Variant: Posadist  A. Inspiration, Talk to Dolphin  B. Internationale  C. Neither Gods Nor Caesars D. Nuclear Football Talk to Dolphin You’re able to communicate with dolphins, without any additional tools. They are comrades, after all. Nuclear Football You have a miniature nuke in a suitcase. It takes up 2 slots and possibly has a faulty timer. What you do with it is up to you. I certainly ain’t gonna hassle the person with a nuclear device.
