Tips Appreciated         Templates Investigator      Investigator  Adapted from Rise Up Comus’s Loremaster Sure, sure, anyone can investigate, but you Investigate. Whether you do it to report the Truth, or to keep the lights on in your Detective Agency, well, that’s up to you. Be it natural intuition or a probability computer jammed into your head and hosting a minor AI, well, also up to you. Starting Equipment: Trenchcoat(medium, 4, Conceal), Glock_19 (lr, d6, 6), Notepad PDA Starting Skill: 1) Underworld, 2) Recent News 3) Corporate Affairs A. d4 Investigation Die, 2 Rhetorics B. d6 Investigation Die, 4 Rhetorics  C. d8 Investigation Die, 6 Rhetorics  D. d10 Investigation Die, 8 Rhetorics, Just One More Thing…  Investigation Die Roll your Investigation die each time you call upon a Rhetorics. Should the dice roll a 1-2, then the die is downgraded to the next lower die in the chain. Should it become downgraded on a d4, then you have grown too exhausted to continue your deductive reasoning. A night’s sleep will reset the Investigation Die to its normal value. d4<d6<d8<d10 Rhetorics Rhetorics represent areas of rhetorical reasoning used in finding the crux of the matter. Each time you use a Rhetoric, roll an Investigation Die to test the strain on your mental faculties. A list and explanation of Rhetorics follows: How If you are talking to an NPC about a subject for at least 3 minutes, you may ask the GM “How do they feel about [the subject]?” The GM will answer based on one of the following phrase:  They hate it They’re angry at it. They’re afraid of it. They love it. They’re sad about it. They’re surprised by it. They have no strong feelings.  Language You can translate almost any language, including encoded, given enough time. A Turn for a single inscription or down time for an entire book or meaningful conversation with someone whom you share no language with. Keep a list of languages you’ve translated. After translating the same language three times, you may add it to your Skills. This is basically what Daniel Jackson does. Lies After speaking with a person for at least 3 minutes, you may ask the GM “Are they lying?” Barring any countering obfuscation, the GM will tell you if they are lying, but not what the lie was. Mind Palace You have perfect recall. With a few minutes of concentration (1d10) you may ask the GM to remind you of anything you have seen or heard. Omission After speaking with an NPC for at least 3 minutes, you may ask the GM “What did they omit?” The answer will be vague by nature, but if the person was purposefully omitting something, the GM will tell you. Vice After speaking with a person for at least 3 minutes, you may ask the GM “What is their vice?” What You’re able to ask the GM “What is this?” The GM will give you a name and a one sentence explanation. When After carefully examining a scene, you may ask the GM “When did this happen?” The GM will tell you. Where When you hear the name of a location, you may ask the GM “Where is that?” They will place it on the map for you. Who After carefully observing a scene, you may ask the GM “Who is responsible for this?” If the answer is concealed, the GM gives you one meaningful clue. If the answer is not concealed and it is possible that you could know, they will tell you. Why After carefully observing a scene, you may ask the GM “Why was this done?” If the answer is concealed, you’ll receive one meaningful clue. If it is not, and it is possible you could know, the GM will tell you. Just One More Thing… Once per adventure, if you have motive and means, you may ask a target a question (starting with “Just one more thing”) stating both and automatically force a confession. ##
