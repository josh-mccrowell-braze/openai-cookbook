Tips Appreciated         Inventory Equipment      Communications  Backpack Satellite Uplink (₽8500) - Outside of major cities communication with the Cloud gets rather spotty at best. Satellite uplink provides an area of communication for devices requiring it. Boosters (₽1000) - Like the satellite uplink, but terrestrial. Receives any incoming signal and repeats it, effectively boosting coverage area. Commlink (₽1000) - Life in 20XX is built around these. They act as modern cell phones, data chip readers, cameras, audio recorder, audio player, AM/FM radio, PAN hub controller, digital assistant and much more. All this in a convenient 11”x8”x1” case! Buy yours now, and be sure to pick up the latest attachments today! (Commlink accessories are typically compatible with cyberdecks.)
