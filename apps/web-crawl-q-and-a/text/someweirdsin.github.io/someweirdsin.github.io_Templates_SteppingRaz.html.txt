Tips Appreciated         Templates Stepping Razor      Stepping Razor  You’re the Hero; the Protagonist; World’s Greatest Swordsman. Or maybe you’re the Razor Girl; nerves set to overdrive with fingers full of blades waiting to be used. Whoever you are, you’re a student in the nearly lost art of Ass Kicking, always on the lookout to fight someone bigger and badder than you, until you prove yourself a master. You gain +1 HP for every Stepping Razor template you possess. Starting Gear: Leather_Jacket(light, 2), Katana (mm, d8, 0, Weeb) ×2, Uzi (mr, 1d8, 5, One_Handed) Starting Skills: [1] - Stepping Razor, [2] - Soldier, [3] - Gang Tactics A. Combat Expert, +1 Attack  B. Trophy  C. Signature Weapon, +1 Attack  D. Armed Shield, Unstoppable  Combat Expert You gain +2 to Combat Maneuver rolls. Further, if you get exactly the number you need during an attack roll, make an opposed attribute check as you would during a Combat Maneuver. On a success, you make a free Combat Maneuver. Trophy You collect trophies from high status opponents you defeat; be it a hachimaki of a rival bosozoku leader or a scrap of cloth barring a Corporate logo taken from a former security guard Captain - as long as it is possible for someone to identify and realize that they associate with the trophy. You gain a +1 Attack against those sorts of people. These bonuses stack, though after a while the bosozoku should run out of people. The trophies also make negotiations with that group more difficult. Signature Weapon Choose a weapon you’ve used before. You gain +2 to Attack when using that weapon. Armed Shield On a successful Grapple Maneuver against a target with a ranged weapon, you may make a free attack action against any other target, at a -2 attack modifier, using the grappled target’s weapon. Additionally, any attack made against you while the grapple is held, gets redirected to the grappled target. Unstoppable When you fell an opponent down to 0HP with an attack, you gain a free attack action with the same weapon.
