Tips Appreciated         Templates Console Jockey      Console Jockey  You’re a console cowboy; master of the realm digital. You collect military grade computer hardware and AI programs (called Warez) for nefarious activities in cyberspace. Stay outta Memphis hotel rooms. For every template in Console Jockey you take, you gain +1 processing die, + 1 cache slot, +2 Warez. What do these mean? See the Hacking section for more details. Starting Equipment: Glock_19 (lr, d6, 6), CyberDeck, 2 Cassettes Starting Skills: [1] - Coding, [2] - Cryptocurrency, [3] - Dive Bars A. +1 processing die, + 1 cache slot, +2 Warez; Modifications  B. +1 processing die, + 1 cache slot, +2 Warez  C. +1 processing die, + 1 cache slot, +2 Warez  D. +1 processing die, + 1 cache slot, +2 Warez; Escape the Meat Prison  Modifications You’ve built your CyberDeck by yourself, piece by piece. Should you manage to acquire another Jockey’s unbroken CyberDeck, you may attempt to scrap it for parts to add to your own. Escape the Meat Prison Should you die while Projecting, lose half your levels and rewrite as AI at the new level. You retain all knowledge and digital holdings you had when you were alive. The CyberDeck This is your portable supercomputer. I say portable, but I mean it in the way a cooler is portable. “Yes, technically,” but still a pain in the ass. It takes up two Inventory slots, and requires two hands to use. While you can store up to 10 Warez in the data storage of the deck, only Warez in the cache slot can be executed. Loading Warez are typically done before deployment to the field, as they take roughly an 10 minutes to transfer. The most typical way to interface with your Deck is through electrodes, worn on the temples of the user, and jamming electronic signals straight into their brain meat, blending the Digital and the Real. Also popular is plugging straight into a HeadDrive with connection to visual augments. Most Console Jockeys are experienced enough to know wireless connection is a bad idea.
