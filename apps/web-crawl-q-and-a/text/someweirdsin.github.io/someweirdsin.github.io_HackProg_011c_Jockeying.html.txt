Tips Appreciated         Computer Things Jockeying      Jockeying    Ascension and Fall (repeated)  How does one describe becoming a god? The expansion of consciousness as the trodes slip on, feeding additional sensory data straight into the brain, bypassing the crude, unreliable, bioorganic sensory organs. Optic nerves buzzing in electric voodoo as the seen physical realm is mixed with the digital signals being jammed straight into the biological neural network. A constellation of information nodes, clouds of ones and zeros, the Unknown being replaced with the Known, a True Language of the Birds. Conceptualization IS Being. The heart races, the breath quickens, though the meat is quickly forgotten. The prison built by the Demiurge is Finally Escaped. The Redemption of Sophia. Consciousness melding with One to become All. And then, the trodes come off. And once again you find yourself, bound by form. Knowing trapped behind the slow process of Learning. Once again you are a servant to the cruel flesh, and its tyrannical needs. Water, food, breath - and then expulsion as it uses up resources given, and moves on to the next, ever consuming. Ruled by chemical reactions and addictions. This can be rather upsetting and disorienting to new Console Jockeys. Old Jockeys are usually jaded, but no less longing to return to the True Freedom. Burnt out Jockeys whisper tales of runs past, offering tips and hard earned wisdom - Digital Bodhisattvas, cut off from their rewards this go around.   Jockeying Basics  Warezs are kept on individual Cassettes until loaded into your data storage of the CyberDeck. You get one cache slot per Hacker template that can hold a single ware. Warez are loaded from storage to cache, and take about 10 minutes to transfer between the two. You get one processing die (d6) per level that can be used to execute a ware in cache. These are refreshed by a night’s worth of defragmenting. You execute Warez by allocating your processing die to a ware in cache and then rolling them. The more dice, the more effective the ware execution. Each die you invest has a 50% chance of returning (on a 1-3) into your processing pool. You do these on your CyberDeck.   Warez  These aren’t your publically available JWPce, these are experimental military grade software designed specifically for cyberwarfare. Low intelligence AI generated to perform a very specific purpose.   Cassettes  These are high capacity analog magnetic tape that store the ones and zeros of a military grade ware. Taking the time to transfer the ware onto your CyberDeck provides you with an empty cassette that can be reused. You can run directly from the cassette, skipping cache and providing a free processing die, however this destroys the cassette in the process. Military security feature. You may allocate additional processing dice to this process if you wish.   CyberDeck  This is your custom built, homemade supercomputer. It takes up two Inventory slots, and requires two hands to use. Initial internal storage is enough space for 10 Warez, or significant files.   Faults and Snowcrashes  Because of the experimental nature of it all, sometimes you encounter system errors. Faults are relatively minor errors and occur when the processing die produces doubles. Snowcrashes occur when triples are rolled, and are horrible. Don’t roll triples. Or quads. Based on the digit rolled, consult the below tables: Faults  Resource hog - Dice only return to your pool on a 1-2 for 24 hours. Ctrl+Alt+Del - Cannot execute any Warez for 1d6 rounds while the tasks restart. Static Arc - Take 1d6 damage Zombie process - An unterminated process is taking up a processor. Lose one processing die for 24 hours. Feedback - Blinding patterns overwhelm your AR interface. Blind for 1d6 rounds. Security Alert - Network security is aware of your presence.  Snowcrash  Advanced Alert - Network security is aware of you AND your exact location. Ah, shit - …AND your personal identification information. Visual Cortex Feedback - Piercing light burns out your eyes. Blind permanently. Power Surge - A power overload destroys your CyberDeck. It’ll take the better part of a week, and the proper parts, to build a new one. Bio-Short Out- Part of your brain has been altered by the feedback. Roll 1d6 to determine body location. It is now Disabled. Prison of Your Own Flesh - A feedback error causes you to hallucinate for 48 hours straight. As it dies down, you find yourself unable to return to your deck, the horrors you saw scaring you off it again and again.  Quads The feedback is too much for your central cortex to handle. Your brain is erased like an old floppy disc exposed to magnets. Intelligence drops to 0 as you become Brain Dead. You’re effectively Dead.   Modifications  As stated, your CyberDeck is custom built by you. Should you manage to get your hands on another Hacker’s undestroyed deck, and live long enough to keep it, you can dismantle the thing and add parts to yours, improving it. Modifications take about a week to integrate. Roll 1d12 to see what you can scavenge:  AR Jack - Allow an additional person to view your AR Cache Memory - +1 to Cache slot Cassette Slot - Gain an extra Cassette Slot Intrusion Detection Neural Network - CyberDeck gains +2 to Saves I/O Board - Useful in replacing your burnt out I/O board Larger Drive - +2 to Internal storage Motherboard - Useful in replacing your burnt out Motherboard Porn Stash - +1 Android Porn file Processor Core - +1 Processing Die Stored Ware - +1 random ware Username/Password - +1 Username and Password file Virtual Agent - +1 Virtual Agent
