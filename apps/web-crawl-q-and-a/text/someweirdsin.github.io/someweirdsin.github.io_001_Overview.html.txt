Tips Appreciated          Overview  CyberGLoG is based on Arnold K.’s “Goblin Laws of Gaming” homebrew system, also known as the GLOG. Original game rules and content can be found at goblinpunch.blogspot.com The following content is meant to be a cyberpunk flavoring of that core rule set, and as such borrows heavily from it, with a few adjustments here and there.   Base Character  The following describes your character before the application of templates.   Level  HP  Attack  Save  Cred    1  Con - 4  11  6  0    2  Con - 2  12  7  500    3  Con  -  8  1000    4  Con +2  13  9  1500    5  +1 Assist  -  10  2500    6  +1 Assist  14  11  3500    7  +1 Assist  -  12  4500    8  +1 Assist  15  13  6000    9  +1 Assist  -  14  7500    10  +1 Assist  -  15  9000    +1  +1 Assist  -  -  +2000      Level  A measure of your character’s power. It goes up as you gain XP. At each level you gain an additional template (up to a max of 4) and the accompanying abilities, in addition to the base character listed above. You can also test a single stat of your choosing to see if it improves. To do so, roll 3d6. If it is equal-or-higher than the current stat, it improves by 1. At level 4 a character has access to their full array of abilities, and is considered “fully trained”. Gaining abilities past 4th level is done in one of two ways:  Cash - It’s the future of the 80’s where money rules everything. For the right price, you can purchase augments and upgrade your body. Surviving weird shit - Survive a blast from an experimental phase-shifter cannon from a zaibatsu science technician? Well, now you can force your way through solid materials.  Alternatively, anytime you gain a new level at 5th or higher, you’ve the option to retire your character in safety - out of the reach of the GM. Characters retired before level 5 may return as macguffins or NPCs, their lives fully susceptible to loss or betrayal.   Base Mechanics  Almost everything is based on rolling a d20 against a target number. If you roll equal to or under the target number, you succeed (“meeting is beating”). Roll over it, and you’ve failed. 1 is always success, 20 is always failure. “Roll under” and “Test” will be used throughout the text as a short-hand. Situational bonuses and penalties are usually +/- 2 or 4, applied to the target number. Contested checks are also resolved in this manner. The player makes their check with an adjustment based on how far the opponent’s stat is from 10. Examples: Shoving: The PC has Str 11, the Hobo Tweaker has Str 16. The PC needs to roll 5 to succeed, since 11 – 6 = 5. Attacking: The PC has Attack 12, the Heavy Security Guard has Defense 16. The PC needs to roll a 6 or less to succeed, since 12 – 6 = 6.   Stats  Characters have 6 stats, which serve as vague descriptions of their physical and mental prowess. Strength: Tested when you attempt feats of Strength: Shoving, climbing, forcing open doors, etc. Effects the number of items you can carry. Dexterity: Tested when trying to dodge traps, leap over obstacles, or perform delicate operations under pressure. Half of your Dexterity is the number of “Quick Inventory” items you can have. Constitution: Tested when trying to resist disease, drowning, radiation, and the like. Your hit points are based on your Constitution and level. Intelligence: Tested when asking esoteric questions about the world. Also determines the number of skills you can have. Wisdom: Tested when attempting to discern lies, spot hidden dangers, and to resist mind altering effects. It also determines your initiative. You’ll test initiative every round of combat to see if you act before or after opponents. Charisma: Test to flatter or beguile. While social interaction is done at the table, potential edge cases are determined via Charisma test. It also affects the number of Hirelings you can manage.   Other Numbers  These are basically sub-stats. Listed are their primary modifiers, however Templates, Augments, and Gear may potentially modify them as well. See these particular sections for more details. Attack: Starts at 11, and increases with level per the chart. Roll under Attack, modified by the target’s Defense, to hit. Defense: Starts at 10, modified by Armor. Light Armor is +2, Medium armor is +4, Heavy Armor is +6. Shields offer +1. Roll under Defense, modified by target’s Attack, to defend. Initiative: Starts at Wisdom and is modified by Templates, Augments, and/or Gear. Written separately here as a quick reference. Movement: Starts at 12. Determines how far you can move (about 60’; 5’ per 1 Movement), and is used in a contested test to safely disengage with an enemy in melee. Affected by Armor (-0 for Light Armor, -2 for Medium Armor, -4 for Heavy Armor) Save: Starts at 5 and increases with Level. If an attack or challenge doesn’t fall neatly, or agreeably, under any other stat or value, roll Save. It represents the character’s luck and ability to spit in the face of Fate. Stealth: Starts at 5 and acts as a penalty to opponents Wisdom to notice you. Affected by Armor (-0/-2/-4), Encumbrance, and environment.   Conviction  This life you’ve found yourself in is out right dangerous, more so given the world you live in. The lifestyle is often uncomfortable, morally questioning, and did I mention dangerous? No one takes it up without a good reason. All the better to stay a corporate cog, consuming mindless entertainment and corn-based substances. But not for you. You long for something better, something meaningful. You’ve been cursed with Conviction. Not everyone has Conviction, especially these days, but Player Characters always do. A Conviction is your character’s answer to one of these questions:  Why did I start this lifestyle? What am I willing to risk my life for? What principles will guide my actions?  There are two blank spots on your character sheet for Convictions. You can fill these in whenever you want. Have a clear picture of the character when you start? Fill them in. Not sure about who your character is? Play them for a bit, get the feel of them, and fill it in when their Convictions reveal themself to you. However, you can’t gain or spend Conviction points until you have at least one Conviction. A Conviction might be “Find my brother.” Or “Bring down Marcone.” Shoot, even “Sup, girl?” can be a Conviction. You gain Conviction points whenever following a Conviction gets you into trouble. Or, at least, when following the Conviction is not an optimal strategy, yet you follow it anyway. If you leave a crime boss for the cops instead of putting a bullet in his because you have the Conviction of “Due Process,” knowing full well he can send goons after you from prison, take a Conviction point. You’re doing what you know to be Right, not easy. Conviction Points can be spent to get a bonus on a d20 roll.  If the roll is related to a Conviction: +8 If the roll is unrelated to a Conviction: +4  You can only receive the large bonus if the roll is related to your Conviction. If your Conviction is “Find my brother” and the action leads you closer to finding said wayward brother, take a +8. However, if you need some help dealing with an Everglades methgator, you’ll get the +4. Typically, characters can only have 1 point of Conviction at a time. Some Templates may modify this.   Skills  Skills are just a word that describes something your character knows how to do. If you can convince the GM the skill applies for a test, you take a +2 bonus. You start off with three skills, determined by your Failed Career, your level 1 Template, and 1 of your choosing. These include non-native languages. You may have a total of 3+(Int/4) skills. Skills cannot be used directly in combat.
