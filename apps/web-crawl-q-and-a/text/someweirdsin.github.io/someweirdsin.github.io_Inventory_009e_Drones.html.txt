Tips Appreciated         Inventory Drones      Drones  Drones are semi-autonomous devices that come in various sizes and are made for various purposes. From maglev mounted cameras to a weapons platform mounted on Boston Dynamics’ cheetah, each brings a unique edge to a mission. Controlling a drone takes a full round action to issue a command to a single drone, unless one has a Drone Control Unit. Then, you’re able to control a single drone per Control Unit as a free action. Drones have three modes of operation: defense, offense, and operation. Defense mode provides +1 to the operator’s Defense. Offense mode provides +1 to the operator’s Attack. Operation mode is based on the function of the drone: camera drones will transmit images, echo drones will retransmit signals, autopets will purr and be cute. If a drone isn’t outfitted to perform a mode, it will do so at the expense of itself - camera drones will place themselves between the operator and bullets as best they can in Defense mode, or just smack themselves into a target as hard as they can in Attack mode. Both of these cause damage to the drone. Should a drone be caught outside of combat on its own (not assisting the operator and therefore not following the follower/mercenary rules as vaguely implied above) the base stats are Attack/Defense 10, mobility 12 (if not immobile), with Stealth 5.   Stats  Drones have four pieces of information associated with them:  HP: This is the factory set health points of the drone. Size: This is the size of the drone. Mobility: This details how the drone gets around, if it does. Special: This basically tells the function of the drone.  Size - Drones are available in one of four sizes (small, medium, large, and heavy) before they technically become vehicles and things start getting weird. Small drones take up 1 inventory space. Medium drones take up 3. Large drones require equipment to move. Heavy drones typically only move under their own means. Health Points (HP) - Available in 4, 6, 8, and 10 HP. Drones do not naturally heal by themselves and require a mechanic to repair. Once at 0 HP the drone is broken and unusable until repaired. HP is typically tied to Size, however some are potentially more fragile in their constructions. Mobility - This describes how the drone moves.  Aquatic means it only operates on water Flight means it flies. Most popular selection. Immobile drones do not move. Treads move through soft terrain with ease. Walkers have legs. For walking. Wheels operate best on solid, flat surfaces.  Special - This is basically everything else needed to fully describe the functions and operations of the drone.   List of Drones  Presented is a list of publicly available market drones. For more exotic and spicy drones, you’ll need to steal or find a source in game.
