Tips Appreciated         Computer Things Warez      Warez  Weapons grade software developed by the military for the sole purpose of infiltrating and destroying enemy systems that have, naturally, found their way into the hands of a portion of the general public. While the warez will affect augments and devices alike, should a targeted individual be without augments (a rarity these days) they are immune to the ware. Their devices are still targetable. Ware names are the Code Names applied during development .Also included are the Genus Species classifications used in the military’s organization. Name (Genus::Species)  T: Target D: Duration R: Range Absurdity (Utility::Augments::Head)  T: Person D: 1 minute R: 30’  Target Saves or their augments begin sending signals to their brain over writing their natural concern. This causes them to find one thing completely absurd. The Jockey chooses which things the victim considers absurd. The target does not fear, & cannot be intimidated by, the absurd object. If 2 dice are invested, a person can be the absurd object; one additional person or object can be included per die.

Atavism (Offensive::User)  T: Person D: [Dice] minutes R: 10’  Target Saves or has their Frontal Lobes shut down, and adrenal glands sent into overdrive.

Burning Gaze (Offensive::User::Device)  T: Devices D: [Dice] rounds R: Self  Any device you look at for the duration catches on fire, if human-sized or smaller.

Effectively, for the duration, you can punch AI for d4 damage (d6 if 3 dice are invested, and d8 if 5 are invested). Digital Knock (Utility::Device)  T: Lock D: Instant R: Touch  Instantly opens any electronic lock. Can counter a Digital Lock ware if an equivalent number of spell dice are invested.

Unless 4 or more dice are invested, the invisibility ends as soon as the target attacks.

Sign Post (Utility::Area)  T: Area D: [Dice] days R: 10’  The user is able to leave a [Sum] length message within the cloud, bound to their current location. This message is viewable by all.
