Tips Appreciated          Contacts, Groupies, and Mercenaries    Contacts  Essentially these are your “business contacts.” They’ll provide resources and assist in tasks outside of combat for a price. Examples:  An arms dealer can arrange for weapons without serial numbers. A black market dealer can provide illegal goods. A greasy journalist or observant bartender might be able to provide promising rumors.  Contacts are made in game, through roleplay. Also, more quickly, through the Fixer template. Their loyalty is not guaranteed, and they will not engage in combat on your behalf.   Groupies  Your charisma has acquired you a near cult following. These are admirers of you, and are willing to provide resources and assist in tasks outside of combat. They will, however, require a favor in return. These people have a “normal life” inside of society and what they’re capable of is determined by a role on the “Failed Career” list. Only, their career is still intact. They are mainly acquired through the Face template, and their loyalty is nearly guaranteed. They will not engage in combat unless Fanatic (see Face template). They provide 10 inventory slots, and +1 Attack and Defense, but do not take combat turns.   Mercenaries  These are trained professionals of the illicit arts. Thugs, assassins, guns for hire. They’re skilled at what they do, and reflect that through their hiring price, to be paid upfront. In combat, each mercenary will provide a +2 Attack and +2 Defense to the person they’re assigned to, but will not take combat turns themselves. If you take damage that would result in Lethal Damage, there is a 50% chance a mercenary assigned to you takes it instead. You can command up to a number of Mercenaries equal to your Charisma attribute. It may not be fiscally wise, however. A mercenary can perform tasks based on their advertised skill (A cat burglar will do cat burglary things, etc). If they notice they’re being ordered to take more risks than the PCs, prepare for some resistance, and a loyalty check. Leveled mercenaries will provide additional +1 Attack/Defense for every level over 1, as well as additional abilities, however they will cost substantially more. You acquire them on a per job basis using cold, hard cash.   Loyalty  Loyalty starts at 10. Poor treatment lowers Loyalty by 1, 1d4, or 1d6 points. Good treatment raises Loyalty by 1 or 2 points, to a maximum of 19. Overpayment also raises Loyalty.
