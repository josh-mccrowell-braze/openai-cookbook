Tips Appreciated         Inventory Weapons      Weapons  Weapons are defined by the following function: int Weapon_Name(category, damage, reload, -special)
//---------------------------------------
//
// Category
//     Weapon categories are made up of a combination between [light, medium, 
//heavy] and 
//[melee, range], each of which provide implied characteristics. 
//     * Light weapons fit two to an inventory slot, can be used one handed, 
//and require a Wisdom 
//check to be found during a search
//     * Medium weapons take up a single inventory slot 
//     * Heavy weapons are obvious, require two hands to use, and take up two 
//inventory slots
//     * Melee weapons typically have a reload score of 0 and are silent
//     * Range weapons require ammunition to function and typically require two 
//hands. 
//     * Grenades are light range weapons that are consumed on use. 
//
// Damage
//     The amount of damage done to Hit Points on a successful attack. If no 
//value is present, use 
//default values:
//     * Light weapons typically do 1d6 damage
//     * Medium weapons typically do 1d8 damage
//     * Heavy weapons typically do 1d10 damage
//
// Reload
//     The value that, when naturally rolled equal to or below during an Attack 
//roll, triggers the need for a reload. May be affected by certain Combat 
//Maneuvers. Scale is between 0-20. Examples:
//     * Sword 0 - Unable to roll <0; no need for reload
//     * Minigun 1 - Huge magazine, rarely runs out of ammunition. 
//     * SMG 7 - Reloads 35% of the time. 
//     * Bow 20 - Reloads with every shot. 
//
//Special
//     Denotes any special or different ability, or damage type the weapon may 
//have. Any defined special should be immediately documented.
