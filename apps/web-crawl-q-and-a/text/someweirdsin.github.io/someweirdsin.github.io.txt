Tips Appreciated         Things get too straight  I can’t bear it  I feel stuck, stuck on a pin  I’m trying to break in  Oh, I know it’s not for me  But the sight of it all  Makes me sad and ill  That’s when I want  Some weird sin  Yeah, some dumb weird sin  For a while anyway  With my head out on the ledge  That’s what you get out on the edge   – Iggy Pop, Some Weird Sin     Some Weird Sin  Looking to play a cyberpunk ttrpg, but unhappy with the main stream systems? Cyberpunk 2020’s got too much crunch, some of the “rules lite” stuff doesn’t have enough. Or maybe the server you were using to illegal view Cyberpunk core books was hit by a missle. Either way, I present you this cobbled together mess. Based on the GLoG system by Arnold K, Some Weird Sin (formerly “CyberGLoG”) is a cyberpunk mod/hack/skin seeking to provide the simplified rules of the GLoG to a Cyberpunk setting. I then foul that up by adding in just on more subsystem. But it’s functional, and what I use. You can use it now, without having to wait for the slow production of me putting out a PDF. Or digging through the blog. Some Weird Sin is a game where players take on the roles of down on their luck mercenaries in a world overrun with libertarians, jaded to violence, and fetishizing technology. It’s like if your shitty boomer uncle who can’t open a PDF had a robot arm, but for the whole world. Will you look to make it a better place? Or just do enough to survive?
