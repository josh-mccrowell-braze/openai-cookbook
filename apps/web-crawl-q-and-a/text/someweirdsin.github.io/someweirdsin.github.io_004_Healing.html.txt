Tips Appreciated          Healing and Intoxicants    Healing  Healing hit points are primarily done one of two ways:  A good night’s rest in a Safe House restores all Hit Points, as long as you have security and comfort. Lacking these, it only restores 1d6+level HP. A First Aid Kit restores based on its stats, as do other emergency medical equipment. Usage takes about 10 minutes. See the Gear section for more details.  A Safe House is any secure location you can hold up for a night. Cheap hotel; abandoned warehouse; shoot, an unmarked van in an out of the way car park will work. The important part is you have security and comfort. If a character has “negative” hit points, the next First Aid or Good Night’s Rest heals them to 0 and no further. Healing serious injuries from the Death and Dismemberment table takes time to heal, as listed. Or, possibly, experimental gear stolen from a Medtech lab. Healing Stat points takes a day per point lost, if they haven’t been lost permanently. Purchasing and installing Augments is always an optional shortcut in the healing process. A very popular one.   Intoxication  Ingesting alcohol or drugs bestows points of intoxication, usually denoted in their details. Each point of intoxication expands your critical fail/miss range by 1. So a character with 4 points of intoxication would critically miss on a roll of 16-20. This lasts until the next morning.   Addiction  If a drug or alcohol is labeled as “addictive” a Wisdom check must be performed with each dosage used. Any accompanying number (ie “Additive(2)”) serves as a penalty to the check. Failure indicates an addiction has been formed and without regular doses the character suffers the listed Withdrawal effects. Breaking an addiction takes about 21 days in real life, apparently. What that means mechanically is that for every day you don’t use the substance, roll a d20. If you roll equal or under your days clean, the addiction is broken and you no longer suffer the Withdrawal effects. Convenient how that worked out.
