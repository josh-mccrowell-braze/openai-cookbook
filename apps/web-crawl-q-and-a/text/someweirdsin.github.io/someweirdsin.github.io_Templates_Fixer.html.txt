Mind you this is total, be it across multiple dealers or all with one. Regular repayments are expected, with rather unfriendly results should you seem to be neglecting said payments. I Remember Reading About That Once per day, you may treat your Intelligence as being 20, for the purposes of knowledge related skill checks. I Know A Guy Once per session you can call in a favor owed you by someone within your network of contacts, with a 5-in-6 chance of them willing to accept without payment.
