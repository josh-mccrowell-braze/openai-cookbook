Tips Appreciated          Templates  These are, basically, what other systems refer to as ‚Äúclasses.‚Äù Except you only get four of them at most, can mix and match, and don‚Äôt have to take several empty levels worth to get to a feature. Templates must be taken in alphabetical order , within their same group. If taking a different template group, the next template starts again at A. For example: Face A must be taken before Face B. If taking Hacker next level, the player must take Hacker A. Taking Face again next level allows for Face C. The template taken at level 1 gives the character the listed Starting Equipment and a randomly selected starting skill. As said, only the first four levels provide templates and related abilities. Gaining abilities and growing past level four is done through either purchasing Augmentations to jam into your body, or surviving strange situations. The later is referred to as Delta (ùö´) Templates - should that information ever needed. There are two types of templates presented here: Basic and Eclectic.   Basic Templates  These are templates designed to use the system in the usual manner, with Base Mechanics working as written. Perfect for Beginners and Experienced players alike.  Augmented Console Jockey Face Fixer Stepping Razor Tweeker    Eclectic Templates  These are templates with at least a little weirdness to them. Certain attributes may affect different abilities, Base Mechanics may work a little off kilter, or entirely new mechanics might be provided.  Investigator People‚Äôs Champion  Templates are listed in alphabetical order, but separated here for convenience.
