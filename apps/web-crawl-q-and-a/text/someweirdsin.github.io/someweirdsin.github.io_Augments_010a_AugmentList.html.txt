Tips Appreciated         Augments Augment List    Adrenaline injectors (₽150,000) - Sometimes you just gotta act NOW. Flood your heart with synthetic adrenaline (also spend a point of Conviction) to automatically succeed on Initiative checks the rest of the encounter. Audio Processor (₽75,000) - A processor in your head listens to every sound coming in your ear and compares it to a database of sounds, returning the most likely sound to a visual display of a paired device. Also provides subtitles to conversations for free. Bainti Modulation (₽125,000) - Like the voice modulation, only more so; and your throat is jam packed with vocal equipment. Whenever you speak, your voice rings with a digital quiver. When you shout, well, that’s when things get exciting. You receive 1d6 (consumed on 4-6) and, when rolled, brittle objects within 25’ of you must save or be shattered. People as well must save or be Deafened for [sum] rounds, and stunned for half that. Biomonitor Beacon (₽75,000) - Not really useful for you, but anyone attempting First Aid on you, while using AR, receives +2 on their attempt. Also allows your teammates to see your health status, often represented in a vague number equal to your current HP score. Bright Eyes (₽80,000) - Overcharged LEDs are hidden in your irises. Weird? Sure, but it also allows you to once per day blind a target who you’re making eye contact with, unless they’re able to make Save vs Blindness. CB Radio (₽30,000) - An archaic form of communication, yet one that still functions when away from the Cloud. Send/receive unit with frequency selection is installed in the skull, with the antenna interwoven into the spine. Range is typically 1-2 miles. A port at the base of the spine allows for exterior antenna connection for longer range. Cheetah blood injectors (₽140,000) - They might be extinct in the wild, but somewhere there’s a lab draining their delicious clone blood. Inject it into yourself for +4 to movement for the rest of the scene, at the cost of 1 Conviction point. Winning. Dreaming Real (₽250,000) - An array of holographic projectors bolted just under your skin. They allow you to create a perfect hologram of an object file stored in your Head Drive. It moves and acts as you desire, as long as you concentrate, but cannot provide any other sensory input. Holograms can only add, not subtract, and the target area must be within your line of sight. Deals 1 damage per round of operation. Drone Control Unit (₽110,000) - Typically, control of separate drones over remote controls takes a full round action, and only one may be controlled per action. DCU allows for control of a single drone/vehicle without loss of attention for the user, and, if multiple are taken, all connected drones may be controlled on a single action. Extendable Arm (₽80,000) - Gain five extra feet to your reach. However, you suffer -1 to Attack per every five feet you’ve extended, due to awkwardness. At least you no longer have to get up to get a beer from the fridge. Extra Arm (₽200,000) - You’ve an extra, mechanical arm, and gain all the benefits and awkward clothing situations that come with it. Gills (₽200,000) - You remember Seaman Anthony Piccolo from the second season of SeaQuest DSV? No, of course not. Why would you? I’m not sure why I do. Anyway, you’ve got gills now, right along your ribs. Gyroscope (₽50,000) - You’ve taken a gyroscope out of a modern motorcycle and jammed it into your chest. Because of this you have +2 Defense against being tripped. Hand Grenade (₽25,000) - It looks like a standard cyberware hand, and it is, but it’s also packed full of explosives. Good for when you really need one more grenade right this instant. Just detach and throw. Consumed on use. Head Drive (₽100,000) - You’ve got a hard drive in your head, and a cranial jack at the base of your skull. You gain 5 “Inventory Slots” specifically for data. These slots do not add to Encumbrance. Any Augment that stores to an internal memory may now store multiple files in these Slots. (Retinal Imitation can now store multiple retina patterns; Voice Modulation can now store multiple voices; etc) Healing Factor (₽300,000) - Technically, a modified cancer. You regain 1 HP every 10 minutes. You regain 3 CON per day (rather than 1). Missing limbs regrow over a month, with slight deformities. Hidden Cavity (₽16,000) - Gain an additional Inventory slot. If you’re ever searched, items stored here are not found. Imaging processing array (₽25,000) - Robot eyes connected via silico/vivo interface to your brain. Choose three of the below. Purchasing again allows for selection of another three. All ranges are sight. Includes 20/20 vision and the Utility option for free:  Augmented Reality - Allows for the overview of AR data with normal vision Camera - Records, and broadcasts if you choose, from user’s POV Flare compensation - Provides +2 for saves vs blindness Magnification - Allows for vision magnification up to 50x Night - Imaging processor measures and estimates light waves and allows for vision at night nearly as well as daytime. Colors are muted and 8-bit, as the processor has to guess on occasion. Radiation monitor - Adds false color to detected radiation, as well as a display of estimated sunshine units. Targeting - Interfaces with the user’s gun’s computer, providing +1 to Attack. Thermographic - Measures and displays infrared heat signatures. Ultraviolet - Allows for vision in the ultraviolet spectrum. Good for seeing residues and pollen. Utility - An assortment of useful tools: Compass, GPS display, digital message ticker, digital clock, friend tracking, augmentation report and monitoring.  Implanted Weapon (₽50,000) - select a small/medium melee or range weapon. That weapon is now integrated into your forearm and is immune to being disarmed. Improved Liver (₽120,000) - Oyster DNA has been injected into your liver to improve the toxic filtering. Gain +2 to Save vs Poison. Internal Communication Device (₽62,000) - It’s like a flip phone, but inside your head. By concentrating on a party member, you may contact their communication device without need of verbal communication. Can be set to party line mode. Internal Oxygen supply (₽84,000) - Contains a 30 minute air supply, with an exterior valve for resupply. Mag-Locks (₽125,000) - Strong magnets installed in the hands and feet of the user, allowing for a completely secure grip to any metallic surface. Popular among Orbital workers as it allows them to walk, rather than float semi-helplessly. µSoft Drive (₽85,000) - Why read when you can know? A small port behind your ear allows for connection to tiny storage chips known as µsofts (microsofts). Plugging one in allows you to instantly know the information contained on. Removing causes you to forget. Overclocked Muscles (₽75,000) - Upon activation, you’re treated as having strength 20 for one round. Usage causes 1 Con damage each time. Pheromones (₽200,000) - Ever had a moment where you wish you could take back what you just said? Well, now you can. By spending a Conviction point, you excrete strong, soothing pheromones from a synthetic gland and can “take back” the last sentence you said, forcing the GM to basically ignore it in NPC reaction. Polygraphic Sensors (₽45,000) - While observing a subject as they speak, you’re able to detect when they’re lying. Not necessarily what the lie was, just that one is present. RearWatch (₽95,000) - Most people prefer to keep their sensory implants where their sensory organs are. Less traumatic and disorienting that way. You, however, have radar installed in the back of your head; gain a 5-in-6 chance to still act on a surprise round. Recall (₽100,000) - Powerful electro-ferrimagnets are installed in the user’s hand, specifically paired to matching magnets installed in an item, allow for instant retrieval of said object. With a moment’s thought, if the item is within Movement range, it returns to the user’s hand. It’s typically installed in weapons, but I ain’t gonna judge you one way or the other. Retinal Imitation (₽85,000) - By uploading a detailed scan of a retina to the augment’s internal memory, the user may mimic that retina pattern. SimSense Broadcasting Unit (₽35,000) - Livestreams user’s received input. Seeing, hearing, touch, taste; all broadcasted to receiving units. SimSense Recording Unit (₽70,000) - Records the sensor input received by the host. Seeing, hearing, touch, taste; all recorded. Has enough space to record 24 hours. Sonar System (₽95,000) - Redundancy is great and all; a life saver even. Though, when you take the Fishfinder system off of a boat, wire it to a silico/vivo interface and jam it into your skull, you gotta start asking questions. Spend a Conviction point to ignore a Blindness. Spider legs (₽250,000) - Appearing as a standard pair of bifurcated legs, only chromed. Upon command, they further bifurcated into legs tipped with sharp dactylus. This allows free movement up nearly any surface, with your hands remaining free. Typically, climbing requires all four limbs. Spiked Heel (₽87,000) - You’ve got a sharp, retractable spike hidden within your foot. This allows for a surprising 1d4 of damage against anyone grappling you. No, I don’t know how your foot and ankle still bend. Spring Heel Jacked (₽115,000) - You’ve replaced your hamstrings with the spring out of a vehicle’s suspension. I can’t claim to know your motives, but falling damage is now reduced by 1d12 points. Also, you can jump an additional 10’ without a test. Sub-Dermal Armor (₽160,000) - Patches of ceramic based non-Newtonian fluids are implanted just under the skin, providing damage reduction of 1 to all incoming attacks (to a minimum of 1) Synthetic Skin (₽130,000) - More than just a skin graph, a pigment modulator allows for a complete changing of color to the user’s skin. If a Head Drive is installed with the modulator, the user has more defined control over the pigment altering, to the point where a user may display images and messages over their skin. By adjusting to the primary color of the surrounding environment, visual based stealth is increased by 2. Word of warning though, it itches like a bastard for the first week after surgery. Tactical Assessment (₽85,000) - By running a live feed of an opponent through the military training computer you’ve decided to lodge in your head, you’re able to determine and estimate their abilities and tactics. After observing an opponent for a round (as your action), you learn their level, HP, and any implants. Spending an additional round focusing gains +2 to Attack, Damage, and to overcome the target’s Save. This bonus lasts until the end of the scene. Taste Editor (₽60,000) - Trying to impress a client, but simply hate the taste of escargot? Got an uncontrollable sweet tooth? Drinking water still tasting like sulfur, even after all the filters? Worry not, for now you can simply edit your troubles away! Any taste that crosses your tastebuds can now be changed to whatever you choose. Or simply removed altogether. Taste Sensor (₽85,000) - Its a chemical analyzer, but for your mouth. Provides a visual display to a paired device of the ingredients, and estimated percentages, of detected substances. It will report any known poison, however it will not protect against it. That’s not what it does. Thief’s Hand (₽16,000) - An array of tools for thieving stored in a prosthetic hand. Throat Weasel (₽125,000) - A prehensile cable with retractable, spinning blades (1d8) and just smart enough to seek out the beating of a heart. Also, it lives in your throat, and is capable of being extended up to two meters out of your mouth. I’m not gonna tell you what to do with it. UV Protection (₽75,000) - A popular augment with miners in Antarctica due to the huge hole in the ozone. Even with the becoming in-debt to the company to cover it. Melanin in the user’s skin is altered to produce a navy blue-purplish pigment. Hair and eye color are also affected. Mechanically, this provides Damage Reduction of 4 against Radiation. Venom Injectors (₽20,000) - Usually installed in fingertips, though some people like to replace their canine teeth with it, this allows for a once per combat poison attack. Exact effects are based on the poison, and drugs will probably be treated as poisons. A roll of 20 means you’ve injected your own dumb self. After each usage the augment needs 20 minutes to synthesize a new dosage. Voice Modulation (₽98,000) - Given a sample of the target’s voice stored to the augment’s memory, and an hour for the Augment’s neural network to train, you can mimic the target’s voice. Time to confirm a bunch of collect calls. Watch-Man (₽20,000) - Named after the portable CD players that would skip with every step, thi augment is a tiny video screen installed, usually, on your forearm. Why an analog screen in the world of AR? Privacy, mostly. With AR anyone with an AR unit could see the projection, whereas only people looking directly at the augment screen can see it. WhisperSoles (₽140,000) - Like a cat in Kitten Mittens, your sound based stealth has increased by 2. Wired Muscles (₽200,000) - Thin strands of shigawire are threaded into and around your muscles which, when electrified in a specific manner, adds ‘muscle memory’ to your untrained muscles. Uses a specially modified µSoft port to load muscle memory plugs, which provide a +2 to specified Combat Maneuvers. Wireless Eye (₽20,000) - A simple cyberoptical prosthetic in communication with a receiver in your head. Given the nature of the IoT, in crowded locations, distance of the connected could, potentially, be measured in miles.
