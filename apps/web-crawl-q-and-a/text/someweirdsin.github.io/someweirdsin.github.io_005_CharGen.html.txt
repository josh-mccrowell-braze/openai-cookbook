Tips Appreciated          Character Generation  Now that the brass tacks are out of the way, it’s time to get to making a character.

Choose your first Template. Gain the A abilities, skill, and listed items. Take another skill of your choosing. Gain the starting items below. Roll your starting cash (1d3 x ₽1000) and purchase additional gear from the Gear section. Pocket any extra cash.

Enough Street Cred and you’ll find yourself in a tougher world, doing harder jobs. You got this though. When you earn a certain amount of Street Cred (detailed on the chart) you gain a level. Whenever a character levels, increase their HP, Attack, and Save based on their new level, per the chart. Additionally, a player may increase a stat of their choosing. Simply declare the stat and roll 3d6. If the result is over, increase the stat by 1.
