Tips Appreciated   Templates Fixer  Fixer You’re a professional middle man. When people need to find information or a special something, they come to you. When people are in need of buyers or to have a body go missing, they come to you. Making arrangements between the two parties is your forte. To you, information is just as good as currency, as it will certainly be worth something. You gain +1 Contact with every Fixer template taken. Starting Equipment: Kevlar_Vest (medium, 4), Uzi (mr, 1d8, 5, One_Handed) Starting Skill: [1] - Black Market, [2] - Conspiracy, [3] - Political Dealings A. Well Connected, Well Prepared B. Done your homework C. Line of Credit, I Remember Reading About That D. I Know A Guy Well Connected When attempting to hire hirelings, treat your charisma score as 2 higher. Well Prepared When in a shady back alley, you may spend any amount of money to receive an unmarked box. When opened, you declare what’s inside, as long as the item(s) are equal or lesser in value than what you paid, and use the correct amount of inventory slots. It is possible to have a smaller box within a box. Done your homework Any very specific detail you learn about your next job adds a point into a special conviction point pool. This pool is usable by the team, may only contain up to the fixer level’s worth points, and these points are only good for the specific job. Line of Credit You’re known for being good to your word. Where most illicit dealings require money up front, usually in a nice briefcase or other easily verifiable form, people who have heard of you or dealt with you before are willing to extend up to 250,000 units of standard currency (nuyen, bitcoin, dollars, whatever). Mind you this is total, be it across multiple dealers or all with one. Regular repayments are expected, with rather unfriendly results should you seem to be neglecting said payments. I Remember Reading About That Once per day, you may treat your Intelligence as being 20, for the purposes of knowledge related skill checks. I Know A Guy Once per session you can call in a favor owed you by someone within your network of contacts, with a 5-in-6 chance of them willing to accept without payment.  "

Tips Appreciated   Inventory Drugs  Drugs The potions of cyberpunk. Chemical cocktails cooked up in laboratories of various qualities. Some have standard delivery forms (alcohol, cigarettes) while others are left vague with no description. In this day and age of chemical synthesis forms are easily enough altered and alternative delivery methods can be found. If a drug or alcohol is labeled as “addictive” a Wisdom check must be performed with each dosage used. Any accompanying number (ie “Additive(2)”) serves as a penalty to the check. Failure indicates an addiction has been formed and without regular doses the character suffers the listed Withdrawal effects. Breaking an addiction takes about 21 days in real life, apparently. What that means mechanically is that for every day you don’t use the substance, roll a d20. If you roll equal or under your days clean, the addiction is broken and you no longer suffer the Withdrawal effects. Alcohol - ₽10 A drink as old as civilization. Comes in countless varieties, strengths, and qualities. Effect: +1 Intoxication point Withdrawal: You suffer “the shakes” as your nervous system goes hyperactive. Cigarettes (Addictive) - ₽15 Sweet, blessed nicotine. Just the thing to feed the hungry nicotine receptors in your brain. Available in various flavors and musical qualities. Effects: Life looks a little more bearable for an hour or so. Also, it makes you look cool. Withdrawal: Severe Headaches and Agitation Endorphins (Addictive) - ₽750 The brain’s natural painkiller, synthesized and fortified with modern chemistry. Each dose gives you the feeling of getting 10 likes on a bird related social media program. I think. I don’t do that well. Effects: Damage reduction of 4 to non-lethal damage for one hour Withdrawal: -6 to max hit points Fight-Stim (Addictive(5)) - ₽1500 Why are hardcore combat drugs found on the street? Because test groups and laboratory trials are expensive, so the corporations “leak” various drugs in development occasionally, to sell directly on the street. Effects: Severe blushing in the face, Restore’s users Hit Points to 150% of normal. +3 Intoxication points. Withdrawal: Max HP is 0, if Addiction check is failed by 10 or more Withdrawal is “Death” Haste (Addictive) - ₽1000 Synthetic cheetah blood mixed with cloned human adrenaline allows the human body to move faster than it’s meant to. Effects: Allows you to double your movement speed for 10 minutes, however for every 5’ past your normal rate, you suffer 1 point of damage. +2 Intoxication points. Withdrawal: Your movement speed is cut in half, and you suffer 2 incurable Encumbrance points until cured of Withdrawal. Hero (Addictive(5)) - ₽1500 Fills the user with an undue sense of confidence and self-worth. Cops love it. Effect: Bestows 1 point of Conviction, usable until end of scene Withdrawal: Max Conviction reduced to 0; -4 to Charisma Hormones - ₽50 Insulin, Somatostatin, Testosterone, Estrogen, Thyroxine, Melatonin, HGH and a wide menagerie of other hormones biological and synthetic, human and nonhuman, can be found on the street, in various forms and capacities. Health care was garbage before the Collapse and it didn’t exactly improve after. Effects: Regulation of various bodily systems. Purge - ₽400 For when you need to be awake and focused NOW. Removes all intoxicants within the user in a rather violent fashion. Effects: Remove all Intoxication points, but suffer twice as much in HP damage. Sapho Juice - ₽700 “It is by will alone I set my mind in motion. It is by the juice of Sapho that thoughts acquire speed, the lips acquire stains, the stains become a warning. It is by will alone I set my mind in motion.” Effects: Increases user’s Intelligence by 2 for 4-6 hours, followed by a heavy hangover. Physiologically addictive. Sugar (Addictive) It’s in every fake “food product” you consume - every damn thing you eat nowadays - purely to make you addicted and coming back for more. Our god damned food is literally poison. Effects: Diabetes, weight gain, brain atrophy Withdrawal: Don’t use this entry in the game, I’m only here pointing out that American food is literally poison. As is the water supply. For fuck sake. Synth-Coke (Addictive(2)) - ₽240 The pharmaceutical answer to “What if cocaine, but non addictive?” They gave up answering the second half, but made better coke. Effects: Heal 1d4 points of Fatigue damage, but take -4 to Saves vs Fear for 1 hour. +2 Intoxication points. Withdrawal: Character suffers -8 to Saves Technicolor - ₽100 A visual hallucinogen lacking the confusing side effects of psychedelics. Effects: Colors become much more intense and vibrant, speaking becomes physically satisfying for 5-7 hours Truthers - ₽500 Developed by remnants of the CIA for “advanced interrogation” methods. Effect: User/victim are unable to lie for one hour. +5 Intoxication points. Mood Alterations - ₽100-₽500 More of a category of drugs, rather than one specific drug. Chemicals within the drug cause the body to generate the biochemicals needed to, well, alter the user’s mood. They’re really the only way to get through the day anymore. Most aren’t Physically addictive, though Happy is Physiologically addictive. Street Name - User’s New Mood Blank - Docile Drudge - Sadness Freak Out - Crazed Happy - Happy Haze - Passive Hype - Aggressive  "

Tips Appreciated   Computer Things Programmming  Programming Hubris “It’s too complicated and probably won’t be used.” Wise and probably true feedback. Wise and probably true feedback I’ve chosen to ignore. A program, simply, is a series of commands written and stored into a file, which are then executed when the computer is instructed to RUN the file. Why, though? In a setting with both hacking and Warez, why have a programming system? It’s simple really: Shut up. It sounded fun - A primary reason I do most things. Programs don’t require Processing Dice - They’re significantly weaker than Warez, but once executed they don’t require additional resources. Programs don’t require attention - They’re not as adaptive as hacking, but once executed the user can walk away without continued need for input. Gives the players an additional chance to do something unexpected - See point 2. Sorry about point 1. Writing a program takes anywhere from a few hours to a few days, including the testing and debugging. Anyone with a computer and enough time on their hands can code a program, though Console Jockeys are just better at it. When writing a program you, the player, will actually need to sit down and write out the program’s instructions (seen below) and hand a copy over to GM for approval or suggestions for possible altering. You then have a discussion with the GM over how long generation of the code will take - probably one command line per hour. Executing A program must be on a device in order to be executed on it, meaning if you want to run a program on a device you’ve just hacked, you’re going to need to Upload it first. If executing a program on your own device, it functions without issue. If executing on a foreign device, you’ll need to roll (d20) to see if the computer understands the program. There is a 70% (14) chance the program of a non-Console Jockey will operate. For Console Jockey’s the odds improve by 5% (+1) for every template taken. Should a 20 be rolled, then the computer crashes trying to figure out the code. On a simple failure, however, the program just doesn’t run. ABASIC You won’t be using just any old programming language for all this, instead you’ll be using the most modern and versatile language available to modern man: ABASIC (Advanced BASIC). Well, a severe abstraction thereof. The following is a list of commands available to you. Defining new commands is possible, however you’ll need to write a supporting program for it, as well as fist fight the General Manager (or ask nicely). ACCESS <directory> - Moves the computer into the specified directory, to continue working. BREAK - A command for interrupting whatever the system is doing. CLS - A command that clears the screen of the terminal. Useless for our games of pretend, but it exists. If you want it. CONNECT <address> - Connects to the remote terminal at the designated address, which is most likely now waiting for an account and password. COPY FROM <source> TO <target> - Copies a file from source location/account to target location/account. DELETE FILE - Erases the specified file. DIM - Declares a variable. DISCONNECT - Opposite of CONNECT. Immediately severs the connection to the remote terminal. Any logged in account remains logged in and unusable until logged off. ELSE - Paired with IF…THEN. If the condition for the IF…THEN is not met, then this code executes. Must be ended with ENDIF ELSEIF - Paired with IF…THEN. If the condition of the first IF…THEN is not met, then checks for another condition to execute other code. Must be ended with ENDIF. END - The last command of a program. Tells the computer to stop what it is doing and without it, the computer will sit and wait forever for more commands. ENDIF - Informs the computer that the IF block structure is over. FUNCTION - Defines the start of a function, in case you want to get crafty with your programming. GOTO <line number> - Moves the computer’s attention to the designated line number. IF…THEN - The command following THEN is executed if and only if the condition in IF is met. Otherwise the computer ignores the section. Can be combined with ELSEIF…THEN and ELSE to form block structures that must end with ENDIF INPUT - Accepts data input from either a terminal or specified file. LIST - Lists the contents of the current account or folder. LOAD - Loads data from the computer for use by the program. LOGON <account> - Inputs the account name to a remote terminal. LOGOFF - Opposite of LOGON. Logs out of the current account. LOOP <condition> - A loop command that causes the computer to repeat a set of commands until the defined condition is met. Loops must end with a NEXT command, or else the computer will only run the loop once and move on. NEXT - Designates the end of a loop. It tells the system to increment its counter and return to the top of the loop in order to repeat the process. PASSWORD <password> - Inputs the account’s password to a remote terminal. PATH /// - Moves a specified file along the defined path. Mostly used in an attempt to confuse any monitoring entities. PRINT <string> - Prints the defined string to the display. REM - Designates a remark or note in the code. Not interpreted by the computer, but it makes it easier for humans to read. In case you forget what a section of code is doing. RUN <program> - Runs the specified program. SAVE <location> - Stores the currently loaded data onto the local drive as a file with the designated filename and location. SEARCH <query> - Queries a file or database for data related to the defined query. SLEEP - Causes the program to pause, waiting until the user presses a key. SORT <condition> - Used to sort the contents of a file or database by the specified condition. TRACE - Used to determine the path back to the terminal where the program originated. UNTIL <condition> - A loop command that causes the computer to repeat a set of commands until the defined condition is met. UNTIL loops execute until its conditions have been met. Loops must end with a NEXT command, or else the computer will only run the loop once and move on. WAIT <time> - Causes the system to wait for the designated time before continuing. WRITE <destination> <message> - Writes the message to the destination location. Should no destination be specified, the command defaults to the console. Comparisons Used in conditions to determine if a specified instance is true. Technically not needed for what we’re doing, but it looks cooler. = equal to is equal to <> not equal to != not equal to greater than < lesser than = greater than or equal to <= lesser than or equal to Examples Waits three hours, connects to a remote computer, enters account log on data, then loads the data to local and saves, before deleting the remote version and logging out. WAIT 3 HOURS CONNECT 126.02.1475.6512 LOGON admin PASSWORD PetiteConnard69420 LOAD ./McGuffinFile.txt SAVE TO D:/Home/StolenFiles/McGuffinFile.txt DELETE FILE ./McGuffinFile.txt LOGOFF DISCONNECT IF…THEN example to show what a block structure looks like. ``` IF var = 1 THEN PRINT “Example 1” ELSEIF var = 2 THEN PRINT “Example 2” ELSE DELETE FILE .

If no //value is present, use //default values: //  * Light weapons typically do 1d6 damage //  * Medium weapons typically do 1d8 damage //  * Heavy weapons typically do 1d10 damage // // Reload //  The value that, when naturally rolled equal to or below during an Attack //roll, triggers the need for a reload. May be affected by certain Combat //Maneuvers. Scale is between 0-20. Examples: //  * Sword 0 - Unable to roll <0; no need for reload //  * Minigun 1 - Huge magazine, rarely runs out of ammunition. //  * SMG 7 - Reloads 35% of the time. //  * Bow 20 - Reloads with every shot. // //Special //  Denotes any special or different ability, or damage type the weapon may //have.

Tips Appreciated   Inventory and Gear Inventory PCs have a number of Inventory Slots equal to their Strength. Inventory slots represent all items carried, save for clothing (besides Armor), minor jewelry, and other cosmetic items. Most items take up one inventory slot. Heavy weapons take up two slots. Armor takes up an amount of slots equal to its Defense rating. Negligible items take up none, nor do coins and gems, should you encounter those antiques in this digital age. The first Dexterity divided by 2 slots are your Belt Slots, and can be accessed easily at any time. Everything else is considered to be in your Pack and requires 1d6 rounds in combat to acquire, or 1 round of dumping everything on the floor. Encumbrance You gain Encumbrance points in 2 ways: Every Inventory slot filled past your Strength score incurs 1 point of Encumbrance. Each point of Defense rating over +3 gained from Armor or Shield incurs 1 point of Encumbrance. Each Encumbrance point imposes a -1 penalty to Stealth, Movement, and Dexterity checks. With 6 points of Encumbrance, running is impossible. At 10 points, <> Like most things, both Inventory slots and Encumbrance can be affected by Augments, Gear, and Templates. Gear Gear typically comes in 3 forms: Armor, Weapons, and Equipment. Armor Armor is divided into three sizes (Light, Medium, Heavy). Every armor takes up a number of Inventory slots based on its size: Light takes up 2 slots, Medium 4 slots, Heavy 6 slots. Additionally, Medium armor imposes 1 point of Encumbrance, while Heavy imposes 3 points of Encumbrance. Armor also affects your ability to swim, should it arise: You can swim in Light Armor without penalty. You must pass a Strength check to swim in Medium Armor You can not swim in Heavy Armor. Light Armor would be your leather jackets, gambeson, or impact mesh. They provide a Defense bonus of 2, and start around ₽200. Medium armor would be kevlar vests, flak jackets, or those chainsaw safety pants things. They provide a Defense bonus of 4, and start around ₽500. Heavy armor is standard riot gear - kevlar over chainmail, interwoven with impact mesh. They provide a Defense of 6 and will run you a hefty ₽1250 or more. Riot Shields will run you ₽1200, take up a free hand, and provide +1 to Defense. Weapons Weapons typically come in three sizes (Light, Medium, and Heavy) across two categories (Melee and Ranged). Light Melee would be your daggers, stun batons, electro-brass knuckles. They typically start at ₽100. Medium Melee would be your sword canes, rapiers, police batons. They take up a single Inventory slot, and start around ₽400. Heavy Melee would be your great swords, chainsaws, jaws-of-life and typically cost ₽650. Light Range would be your hold out pistols and stun guns. Two can fit into a single Inventory slot and typically cost ₽150. Medium Range weapons would be revolvers, machine pistols, and rifles (such as AK47, M16). They take up one inventory slot and typically start at ₽600. Heavy Range weapons would be your miniguns, flame throwers, and sniper rifles. They take up two inventory slots and require both hands to use. The cost starts at ₽1500. Grenades are technically ranged, and do 1d6 damage to everyone in a 20 foot radius. They cost you ₽150 each. Equipment Equipment is basically anything that isn’t Armor or a Weapon, but not an Augment. It’s a wide and varied category and, as such, descriptions and prices are provided below in a definitely non-exhaustive list. . Breakage (Optional) Whenever you make an Attack or Defense check and roll a Critical Failure (20), your Weapon or Armor loses an Endurance point. Weapons and Armor have Endurance points equal to their quality: “Cheap” has 1 point of Endurance “Standard” has 3 points of Endurance “High” has 5 points of Endurance When a Weapon loses an Endurance point, it suffers a cumulative -1 to Attack. At 0 Endurance points, it becomes unusable. When Armor loses an Endurance point, it suffers a -1 to Defense. Further loss of Endurance points do not deplete the Defense rating further. Endurance points can be restored with down time and the use of either a Weapon Repair Kit or an Armor Repair Kit. Table of contents Price List Armor Weapons Equipment Drones Drugs   "

Tips Appreciated   Templates Console Jockey  Console Jockey You’re a console cowboy; master of the realm digital. You collect military grade computer hardware and AI programs (called Warez) for nefarious activities in cyberspace. Stay outta Memphis hotel rooms. For every template in Console Jockey you take, you gain +1 processing die, + 1 cache slot, +2 Warez. What do these mean? See the Hacking section for more details. Starting Equipment: Glock_19 (lr, d6, 6), CyberDeck, 2 Cassettes Starting Skills: [1] - Coding, [2] - Cryptocurrency, [3] - Dive Bars A. +1 processing die, + 1 cache slot, +2 Warez; Modifications B. +1 processing die, + 1 cache slot, +2 Warez C. +1 processing die, + 1 cache slot, +2 Warez D. +1 processing die, + 1 cache slot, +2 Warez; Escape the Meat Prison Modifications You’ve built your CyberDeck by yourself, piece by piece. Should you manage to acquire another Jockey’s unbroken CyberDeck, you may attempt to scrap it for parts to add to your own. Escape the Meat Prison Should you die while Projecting, lose half your levels and rewrite as AI at the new level. You retain all knowledge and digital holdings you had when you were alive. The CyberDeck This is your portable supercomputer. I say portable, but I mean it in the way a cooler is portable. “Yes, technically,” but still a pain in the ass. It takes up two Inventory slots, and requires two hands to use. While you can store up to 10 Warez in the data storage of the deck, only Warez in the cache slot can be executed. Loading Warez are typically done before deployment to the field, as they take roughly an 10 minutes to transfer. The most typical way to interface with your Deck is through electrodes, worn on the temples of the user, and jamming electronic signals straight into their brain meat, blending the Digital and the Real. Also popular is plugging straight into a HeadDrive with connection to visual augments. Most Console Jockeys are experienced enough to know wireless connection is a bad idea.  "

Tips Appreciated   Templates Tweeker  Tweeker Put simply, you’re a man that enjoys a chemical dependency. Doesn’t matter what it is: HyperCocaine, Synthohol, or Crystal Pepsi. You indulge nearly constantly and have a tendency to lose yourself to the whims of the drug. You can ignore +1 points of Intoxication for every Tweeker template you take. Starting Equipment: AR-15 (mr, 1d8, 6), Old_Bat(mm, d8, 0, Concussion), 1d4 doses of your drug. Starting skill: [1] - Streetwise, [2] - Chemistry, [3] - Medical Centers A. Drug Fueled Rage B. Twitchy, Dependant C. Drug Resistance D. Becoming the Drug, Burn Out Drug Fueled Rage By taking a large dosage of your drug of choice, you may enter a drug fueled rage for 4 + {Template] rounds. While enraged you are immune to pain and fear, and gain +1 to your attack and defense. You do, however, lose yourself to the drug. Any action described as “defensive”, “curative”, “cooperative”, or “tactical” is not one your drug-addled mind can comprehend. The drug says FIGHT, so you fight. Using technology any more complicated than a gun, or a weapon implant, is right out. While you won’t target your friends, anyone that harms you (accidental or otherwise) in this fight ain’t a friend until the rage ends. Twitchy The drug has left your nerves a complete mess. When surprised, you have a 3-in-6 chance to act on the surprise round anyway. Dependant Keep those eyes open. Taking a dose of your chosen drug adds 1d4 in temporary HP lasting as long as the drug effects. Stackable up to your level (i.e. 3 doses for 3d4 at level 3) Drug Resistance When in the midst of your Drug Fueled Rage, should you take damage greater than half your remaining HP, you may spend a Conviction point to ignore it Becoming the Drug You’ve entered a new state in your drug habit: A toxic zen. Replace the bonuses from your drug fueled rage with your level. This activates Dependant for free. Burn Out Your heavy drug usage has ruined your nervous system, dulling your connection with the world. All incoming damage is reduced by 2 points, even when you’re sober.  "

Cyberpunk 2020’s got too much crunch, some of the “rules lite” stuff doesn’t have enough. Or maybe the server you were using to illegal view Cyberpunk core books was hit by a missle. Either way, I present you this cobbled together mess. Based on the GLoG system by Arnold K, Some Weird Sin (formerly “CyberGLoG”) is a cyberpunk mod/hack/skin seeking to provide the simplified rules of the GLoG to a Cyberpunk setting. I then foul that up by adding in just on more subsystem. But it’s functional, and what I use. You can use it now, without having to wait for the slow production of me putting out a PDF. Or digging through the blog. Some Weird Sin is a game where players take on the roles of down on their luck mercenaries in a world overrun with libertarians, jaded to violence, and fetishizing technology. It’s like if your shitty boomer uncle who can’t open a PDF had a robot arm, but for the whole world. Will you look to make it a better place? Or just do enough to survive?

Tips Appreciated   Contacts, Groupies, and Mercenaries Contacts Essentially these are your “business contacts.” They’ll provide resources and assist in tasks outside of combat for a price. Examples: An arms dealer can arrange for weapons without serial numbers. A black market dealer can provide illegal goods. A greasy journalist or observant bartender might be able to provide promising rumors. Contacts are made in game, through roleplay. Also, more quickly, through the Fixer template. Their loyalty is not guaranteed, and they will not engage in combat on your behalf. Groupies Your charisma has acquired you a near cult following. These are admirers of you, and are willing to provide resources and assist in tasks outside of combat. They will, however, require a favor in return. These people have a “normal life” inside of society and what they’re capable of is determined by a role on the “Failed Career” list. Only, their career is still intact. They are mainly acquired through the Face template, and their loyalty is nearly guaranteed. They will not engage in combat unless Fanatic (see Face template). They provide 10 inventory slots, and +1 Attack and Defense, but do not take combat turns. Mercenaries These are trained professionals of the illicit arts. Thugs, assassins, guns for hire. They’re skilled at what they do, and reflect that through their hiring price, to be paid upfront. In combat, each mercenary will provide a +2 Attack and +2 Defense to the person they’re assigned to, but will not take combat turns themselves. If you take damage that would result in Lethal Damage, there is a 50% chance a mercenary assigned to you takes it instead. You can command up to a number of Mercenaries equal to your Charisma attribute. It may not be fiscally wise, however. A mercenary can perform tasks based on their advertised skill (A cat burglar will do cat burglary things, etc). If they notice they’re being ordered to take more risks than the PCs, prepare for some resistance, and a loyalty check. Leveled mercenaries will provide additional +1 Attack/Defense for every level over 1, as well as additional abilities, however they will cost substantially more. You acquire them on a per job basis using cold, hard cash. Loyalty Loyalty starts at 10. Poor treatment lowers Loyalty by 1, 1d4, or 1d6 points. Good treatment raises Loyalty by 1 or 2 points, to a maximum of 19. Overpayment also raises Loyalty.  "

Tips Appreciated   Healing and Intoxicants Healing Healing hit points are primarily done one of two ways: A good night’s rest in a Safe House restores all Hit Points, as long as you have security and comfort. Lacking these, it only restores 1d6+level HP. A First Aid Kit restores based on its stats, as do other emergency medical equipment. Usage takes about 10 minutes. See the Gear section for more details. A Safe House is any secure location you can hold up for a night. Cheap hotel; abandoned warehouse; shoot, an unmarked van in an out of the way car park will work. The important part is you have security and comfort. If a character has “negative” hit points, the next First Aid or Good Night’s Rest heals them to 0 and no further. Healing serious injuries from the Death and Dismemberment table takes time to heal, as listed. Or, possibly, experimental gear stolen from a Medtech lab. Healing Stat points takes a day per point lost, if they haven’t been lost permanently. Purchasing and installing Augments is always an optional shortcut in the healing process. A very popular one. Intoxication Ingesting alcohol or drugs bestows points of intoxication, usually denoted in their details. Each point of intoxication expands your critical fail/miss range by 1. So a character with 4 points of intoxication would critically miss on a roll of 16-20. This lasts until the next morning. Addiction If a drug or alcohol is labeled as “addictive” a Wisdom check must be performed with each dosage used. Any accompanying number (ie “Additive(2)”) serves as a penalty to the check. Failure indicates an addiction has been formed and without regular doses the character suffers the listed Withdrawal effects. Breaking an addiction takes about 21 days in real life, apparently. What that means mechanically is that for every day you don’t use the substance, roll a d20. If you roll equal or under your days clean, the addiction is broken and you no longer suffer the Withdrawal effects. Convenient how that worked out.  "

Tips Appreciated   Augments Augment List Adrenaline injectors (₽150,000) - Sometimes you just gotta act NOW. Flood your heart with synthetic adrenaline (also spend a point of Conviction) to automatically succeed on Initiative checks the rest of the encounter. Audio Processor (₽75,000) - A processor in your head listens to every sound coming in your ear and compares it to a database of sounds, returning the most likely sound to a visual display of a paired device. Also provides subtitles to conversations for free. Bainti Modulation (₽125,000) - Like the voice modulation, only more so; and your throat is jam packed with vocal equipment. Whenever you speak, your voice rings with a digital quiver. When you shout, well, that’s when things get exciting. You receive 1d6 (consumed on 4-6) and, when rolled, brittle objects within 25’ of you must save or be shattered. People as well must save or be Deafened for [sum] rounds, and stunned for half that. Biomonitor Beacon (₽75,000) - Not really useful for you, but anyone attempting First Aid on you, while using AR, receives +2 on their attempt. Also allows your teammates to see your health status, often represented in a vague number equal to your current HP score. Bright Eyes (₽80,000) - Overcharged LEDs are hidden in your irises. Weird? Sure, but it also allows you to once per day blind a target who you’re making eye contact with, unless they’re able to make Save vs Blindness. CB Radio (₽30,000) - An archaic form of communication, yet one that still functions when away from the Cloud. Send/receive unit with frequency selection is installed in the skull, with the antenna interwoven into the spine. Range is typically 1-2 miles. A port at the base of the spine allows for exterior antenna connection for longer range. Cheetah blood injectors (₽140,000) - They might be extinct in the wild, but somewhere there’s a lab draining their delicious clone blood. Inject it into yourself for +4 to movement for the rest of the scene, at the cost of 1 Conviction point. Winning. Dreaming Real (₽250,000) - An array of holographic projectors bolted just under your skin. They allow you to create a perfect hologram of an object file stored in your Head Drive. It moves and acts as you desire, as long as you concentrate, but cannot provide any other sensory input. Holograms can only add, not subtract, and the target area must be within your line of sight. Deals 1 damage per round of operation. Drone Control Unit (₽110,000) - Typically, control of separate drones over remote controls takes a full round action, and only one may be controlled per action. DCU allows for control of a single drone/vehicle without loss of attention for the user, and, if multiple are taken, all connected drones may be controlled on a single action. Extendable Arm (₽80,000) - Gain five extra feet to your reach. However, you suffer -1 to Attack per every five feet you’ve extended, due to awkwardness. At least you no longer have to get up to get a beer from the fridge. Extra Arm (₽200,000) - You’ve an extra, mechanical arm, and gain all the benefits and awkward clothing situations that come with it. Gills (₽200,000) - You remember Seaman Anthony Piccolo from the second season of SeaQuest DSV? No, of course not. Why would you? I’m not sure why I do. Anyway, you’ve got gills now, right along your ribs. Gyroscope (₽50,000) - You’ve taken a gyroscope out of a modern motorcycle and jammed it into your chest. Because of this you have +2 Defense against being tripped. Hand Grenade (₽25,000) - It looks like a standard cyberware hand, and it is, but it’s also packed full of explosives. Good for when you really need one more grenade right this instant. Just detach and throw. Consumed on use. Head Drive (₽100,000) - You’ve got a hard drive in your head, and a cranial jack at the base of your skull. You gain 5 “Inventory Slots” specifically for data. These slots do not add to Encumbrance. Any Augment that stores to an internal memory may now store multiple files in these Slots. (Retinal Imitation can now store multiple retina patterns; Voice Modulation can now store multiple voices; etc) Healing Factor (₽300,000) - Technically, a modified cancer. You regain 1 HP every 10 minutes. You regain 3 CON per day (rather than 1). Missing limbs regrow over a month, with slight deformities. Hidden Cavity (₽16,000) - Gain an additional Inventory slot. If you’re ever searched, items stored here are not found. Imaging processing array (₽25,000) - Robot eyes connected via silico/vivo interface to your brain. Choose three of the below. Purchasing again allows for selection of another three. All ranges are sight. Includes 20/20 vision and the Utility option for free: Augmented Reality - Allows for the overview of AR data with normal vision Camera - Records, and broadcasts if you choose, from user’s POV Flare compensation - Provides +2 for saves vs blindness Magnification - Allows for vision magnification up to 50x Night - Imaging processor measures and estimates light waves and allows for vision at night nearly as well as daytime. Colors are muted and 8-bit, as the processor has to guess on occasion. Radiation monitor - Adds false color to detected radiation, as well as a display of estimated sunshine units. Targeting - Interfaces with the user’s gun’s computer, providing +1 to Attack. Thermographic - Measures and displays infrared heat signatures. Ultraviolet - Allows for vision in the ultraviolet spectrum. Good for seeing residues and pollen. Utility - An assortment of useful tools: Compass, GPS display, digital message ticker, digital clock, friend tracking, augmentation report and monitoring. Implanted Weapon (₽50,000) - select a small/medium melee or range weapon. That weapon is now integrated into your forearm and is immune to being disarmed. Improved Liver (₽120,000) - Oyster DNA has been injected into your liver to improve the toxic filtering. Gain +2 to Save vs Poison. Internal Communication Device (₽62,000) - It’s like a flip phone, but inside your head. By concentrating on a party member, you may contact their communication device without need of verbal communication. Can be set to party line mode. Internal Oxygen supply (₽84,000) - Contains a 30 minute air supply, with an exterior valve for resupply. Mag-Locks (₽125,000) - Strong magnets installed in the hands and feet of the user, allowing for a completely secure grip to any metallic surface. Popular among Orbital workers as it allows them to walk, rather than float semi-helplessly. µSoft Drive (₽85,000) - Why read when you can know? A small port behind your ear allows for connection to tiny storage chips known as µsofts (microsofts). Plugging one in allows you to instantly know the information contained on. Removing causes you to forget. Overclocked Muscles (₽75,000) - Upon activation, you’re treated as having strength 20 for one round. Usage causes 1 Con damage each time. Pheromones (₽200,000) - Ever had a moment where you wish you could take back what you just said? Well, now you can. By spending a Conviction point, you excrete strong, soothing pheromones from a synthetic gland and can “take back” the last sentence you said, forcing the GM to basically ignore it in NPC reaction. Polygraphic Sensors (₽45,000) - While observing a subject as they speak, you’re able to detect when they’re lying. Not necessarily what the lie was, just that one is present. RearWatch (₽95,000) - Most people prefer to keep their sensory implants where their sensory organs are. Less traumatic and disorienting that way. You, however, have radar installed in the back of your head; gain a 5-in-6 chance to still act on a surprise round. Recall (₽100,000) - Powerful electro-ferrimagnets are installed in the user’s hand, specifically paired to matching magnets installed in an item, allow for instant retrieval of said object. With a moment’s thought, if the item is within Movement range, it returns to the user’s hand. It’s typically installed in weapons, but I ain’t gonna judge you one way or the other. Retinal Imitation (₽85,000) - By uploading a detailed scan of a retina to the augment’s internal memory, the user may mimic that retina pattern. SimSense Broadcasting Unit (₽35,000) - Livestreams user’s received input. Seeing, hearing, touch, taste; all broadcasted to receiving units. SimSense Recording Unit (₽70,000) - Records the sensor input received by the host. Seeing, hearing, touch, taste; all recorded. Has enough space to record 24 hours. Sonar System (₽95,000) - Redundancy is great and all; a life saver even. Though, when you take the Fishfinder system off of a boat, wire it to a silico/vivo interface and jam it into your skull, you gotta start asking questions. Spend a Conviction point to ignore a Blindness. Spider legs (₽250,000) - Appearing as a standard pair of bifurcated legs, only chromed. Upon command, they further bifurcated into legs tipped with sharp dactylus. This allows free movement up nearly any surface, with your hands remaining free. Typically, climbing requires all four limbs. Spiked Heel (₽87,000) - You’ve got a sharp, retractable spike hidden within your foot. This allows for a surprising 1d4 of damage against anyone grappling you. No, I don’t know how your foot and ankle still bend. Spring Heel Jacked (₽115,000) - You’ve replaced your hamstrings with the spring out of a vehicle’s suspension. I can’t claim to know your motives, but falling damage is now reduced by 1d12 points. Also, you can jump an additional 10’ without a test. Sub-Dermal Armor (₽160,000) - Patches of ceramic based non-Newtonian fluids are implanted just under the skin, providing damage reduction of 1 to all incoming attacks (to a minimum of 1) Synthetic Skin (₽130,000) - More than just a skin graph, a pigment modulator allows for a complete changing of color to the user’s skin. If a Head Drive is installed with the modulator, the user has more defined control over the pigment altering, to the point where a user may display images and messages over their skin. By adjusting to the primary color of the surrounding environment, visual based stealth is increased by 2. Word of warning though, it itches like a bastard for the first week after surgery. Tactical Assessment (₽85,000) - By running a live feed of an opponent through the military training computer you’ve decided to lodge in your head, you’re able to determine and estimate their abilities and tactics. After observing an opponent for a round (as your action), you learn their level, HP, and any implants. Spending an additional round focusing gains +2 to Attack, Damage, and to overcome the target’s Save. This bonus lasts until the end of the scene. Taste Editor (₽60,000) - Trying to impress a client, but simply hate the taste of escargot? Got an uncontrollable sweet tooth? Drinking water still tasting like sulfur, even after all the filters? Worry not, for now you can simply edit your troubles away! Any taste that crosses your tastebuds can now be changed to whatever you choose. Or simply removed altogether. Taste Sensor (₽85,000) - Its a chemical analyzer, but for your mouth. Provides a visual display to a paired device of the ingredients, and estimated percentages, of detected substances. It will report any known poison, however it will not protect against it. That’s not what it does. Thief’s Hand (₽16,000) - An array of tools for thieving stored in a prosthetic hand. Throat Weasel (₽125,000) - A prehensile cable with retractable, spinning blades (1d8) and just smart enough to seek out the beating of a heart. Also, it lives in your throat, and is capable of being extended up to two meters out of your mouth. I’m not gonna tell you what to do with it. UV Protection (₽75,000) - A popular augment with miners in Antarctica due to the huge hole in the ozone. Even with the becoming in-debt to the company to cover it. Melanin in the user’s skin is altered to produce a navy blue-purplish pigment. Hair and eye color are also affected. Mechanically, this provides Damage Reduction of 4 against Radiation. Venom Injectors (₽20,000) - Usually installed in fingertips, though some people like to replace their canine teeth with it, this allows for a once per combat poison attack. Exact effects are based on the poison, and drugs will probably be treated as poisons. A roll of 20 means you’ve injected your own dumb self. After each usage the augment needs 20 minutes to synthesize a new dosage. Voice Modulation (₽98,000) - Given a sample of the target’s voice stored to the augment’s memory, and an hour for the Augment’s neural network to train, you can mimic the target’s voice. Time to confirm a bunch of collect calls. Watch-Man (₽20,000) - Named after the portable CD players that would skip with every step, thi augment is a tiny video screen installed, usually, on your forearm. Why an analog screen in the world of AR? Privacy, mostly. With AR anyone with an AR unit could see the projection, whereas only people looking directly at the augment screen can see it. WhisperSoles (₽140,000) - Like a cat in Kitten Mittens, your sound based stealth has increased by 2. Wired Muscles (₽200,000) - Thin strands of shigawire are threaded into and around your muscles which, when electrified in a specific manner, adds ‘muscle memory’ to your untrained muscles. Uses a specially modified µSoft port to load muscle memory plugs, which provide a +2 to specified Combat Maneuvers. Wireless Eye (₽20,000) - A simple cyberoptical prosthetic in communication with a receiver in your head. Given the nature of the IoT, in crowded locations, distance of the connected could, potentially, be measured in miles.  "

If you’re not part of the ‘In Crowd,’ it’s because you’ve turned them down and they’re worse for it. You gain +1 Groupie for every template of Face taken. A groupie is like a hireling, but paid in favors rather than money. Starting Equipment: Taser (lr, d6, 20, Non-lethal), Blackjack (lm, d6, 0, Non-lethal), Silk Suit (₽500/+4; see below) Starting Skill: [1] - Fashion, [2] - Pop Culture, [3] - Recent News A. Nice Threads, They Know Me Here B. Advanced Street Cred, Pep Talk C. Fanatic Groupies, Gang Uniform D. Really Good Liar Nice Threads Until they start making armor in pinstripe or egyptian silk, you’ll take your chances without. While wearing fashionable clothing of the same cost as related armor, you receive the equivalent defense, but without expending Inventory Slots. The clothing is Fragile however, and you suffer -1 def each time you’re scorched, dirtied, shot, stabbed - anything that would ruin such fine clothing. They Know Me Here You’re a regular at a local dive bar. The patrons are Friendly towards you, and are usually willing to lie for you, given plausible deniability. For a smile and some sweet words to the owner, you can use a backroom unmolested. Advanced Street Cred By recounting your recent adventures to a crowd, say a bar crowd, every character that participated in the adventure, and the retelling, receives an additional 10% of the Cred received during the adventure. Usable once per adventure. Pep Talk Once per session, as a free action, you may give a rousing speech to attempt to bolster the spirits of your allies. Any friends that can hear you regain 1d4 HP (the DM is encouraged to give a +1 or +2 bonus based on vigorous gesturing and if the other players are actually encouraged by the speech). Outside of combat, the speech is worth 1d6. Fanatic Groupies Your good looks and honeyed words have won over the crowds, to the point they’re willing to jump in between you and danger at a moment’s notice. If you take physical damage, you can choose to pass off the damage to an adjacent hireling. They make no additional check or save, merely take the damage meant for you. Gang Uniform While wearing an outfit involving a symbol representing the gang, any allies loyal to the gang and wearing the same symbol receive a +1 to attack. The symbol can be just about anything, as long as it undeniably identifies the specific gang, and members thereof. Really Good Liar Once per session, you may declare any excuse or argument to be both valid and acceptable.  "

Tips Appreciated   Templates People's Champion  People’s Champion In the cold, gray world where the corporations have won, the Union of Unions stands strong as a beacon of hope. Sure, it has its problems, but at least you are Free, unlike the poor souls trapped in the Libertarian hellscape. You must go forth, and bring hope to the masses. For each template gain +1 Save against Fear. Starting Equipment: Leather_Jacket(light, 2), AK-47 (mr, 2d4, 6, Dmg_Cascade), Communist Manifesto Starting Skills: 1) Farming 2) Engines 3) Firearms A. Inspiration, Turn Bourgeoisie B. Internationale C. Neither Gods Nor Caesars D. Nothing to Lose But Your Chains Inspiration The Champion doesn’t get this ability, so much as the team gets the ability. This is a pool of points equal to 1 per People’s Champion template in the team, and usable on various things (listed below) by anyone on the team. To activate, the player using the point must inspire the target in some way. I’m primarily picturing a short uplifting speech, but if you can figure another way, I ain’t gonna stop you. Ways to refill the pool are also listed below. Uses: Restore 1d6 HP to the target Give a +4 to a single test or save. (Traditional assisting only provides +2) Restoration: Champion successfully assists someone Champion takes time to repair gear rather than simply purchase new item Champion shows solidarity with the common man at a detriment to themselves. Turn Bourgeoisie When confronted by the Bourgeoisie or one of their dogs (CEOs, cops), you may speak words of revolution (and spend a Conviction point), then roll 2d6, consulting the chart below. If you roll under the number (meet is beat) the target is turned. A “T” means the target is automatically turned, “D” means the target is destroyed, and “-“ means automatic failure. In cases of dual numbers (ex 11/5), the first number is for turned, the second is for destroyed. Turned targets flee the area for 1d6 rounds. Destroyed targets leave the area for good and rethink the choices they made that lead them to this point. Internationale When meeting members of the Proletariat, reaction rolls are made at a +4. Neither Gods Nor Caesars Adjacent allies may use your Save vs Fear in replace of their own. Nothing to Lose But Your Chains Once per session, by giving a grandstanding, uplifting speech, you can give a free Command (as per the traditional spell) to the audience with no Save. Variant: Posadist A. Inspiration, Talk to Dolphin B. Internationale C. Neither Gods Nor Caesars D. Nuclear Football Talk to Dolphin You’re able to communicate with dolphins, without any additional tools. They are comrades, after all. Nuclear Football You have a miniature nuke in a suitcase. It takes up 2 slots and possibly has a faulty timer. What you do with it is up to you. I certainly ain’t gonna hassle the person with a nuclear device.  "

Tips Appreciated   Computer Things Warez  Warez Weapons grade software developed by the military for the sole purpose of infiltrating and destroying enemy systems that have, naturally, found their way into the hands of a portion of the general public. While the warez will affect augments and devices alike, should a targeted individual be without augments (a rarity these days) they are immune to the ware. Their devices are still targetable. Ware names are the Code Names applied during development .Also included are the Genus Species classifications used in the military’s organization. Name (Genus::Species) T: Target D: Duration R: Range Absurdity (Utility::Augments::Head) T: Person D: 1 minute R: 30’ Target Saves or their augments begin sending signals to their brain over writing their natural concern. This causes them to find one thing completely absurd. The Jockey chooses which things the victim considers absurd. The target does not fear, & cannot be intimidated by, the absurd object. If 2 dice are invested, a person can be the absurd object; one additional person or object can be included per die. Activate Grenade (Offensive::Device) T: Grenade D: Instant R: 60’ Remotely activates a grenade, whether or not a person is holding it.

Alarm (Utility::Area::Device) T: Area D: [Dice] hours R: 100 square ft A single device is locked into detecting signals within [Sum] square feet. If any device or AI enters the area, you instantly know about it. If you so choose, a loud noise can also emanate when the alarm is triggered, heard up to [Dice] x 100’ from the area. You can designate up to [Dice] devices who will not set off the alarm. Your devices are automatically excluded. Allure (Offensive::User::Augments::Head) T: Person D: [Dice] rounds R: Sight Target Saves (with penalty equal to [Dice]) or is compelled to approach you. If they are hostile, they will approach you with hostile intent. Aphasia **(Offensive::User::Augments::Head) **T: Person D: [Dice] minutes R: 120’ Stray signals overwhelm the Broca’s Area of the brain, causing the target to be unable to comprehend language. Target Saves with penalty equal to [Dice]. On failure, they cannot speak or comprehend any language, written or spoken, for the duration. Atavism (Offensive::User) T: Person D: [Dice] minutes R: 10’ Target Saves or has their Frontal Lobes shut down, and adrenal glands sent into overdrive. Target reverts to a primeval, frenzied state; it gets +4 to all saving throws & attack rolls, & +2 to damage rolls, while being unable to determine friend from foe. Aura of Doom (Offensive::User::Devices) T: Devices D: [Dice] rounds R: Self Devices within 15’ of you begin to emit an ultra low sound, causing a fight or flight response in humans. Everyone within range must Save (with a penalty equal to [Dice]) or are terrified of you (they roll Morale immediately). Aversion (Offensive::User::Augments::Head) T: Person D: 1 day R: Sight Target Saves (with a penalty equal to [Dice]) or becomes profoundly averse to an object or location of your choice. The object can’t be something they’re currently holding or touching. Blindness (Offensive::User::Augments::Eyes) T: Person D: Permanent R: Touch Target must Save (with [Dice] penalty) or their Eye based augments malfunction, leaving them Blind until repaired. If used against visual equipment, user Saves or is Blind for [Dice] rounds. Bloodstorm (Offensive::User) T: Person D: Instant R: 20’ Causes the victim’s augments to short circuit, continuously hurting the wearer, the near feral ware then leaps to a new victim. Target must Save or begin Bleeding Out; the process then repeats on the nearest person (friend or foe). This continues [Dice] times, or until a successful Save. Burning Gaze (Offensive::User::Device) T: Devices D: [Dice] rounds R: Self Any device you look at for the duration catches on fire, if human-sized or smaller. For each invested die past 4, double the maximum size of affected objects. Cacophony **(Offensive::User::Augment::Ear) **T: Area D: [Dice]x2 rounds R: 120’ Floods all audio augments and equipment with a deafening cacophony in an area up to [Dice] x 10’ in diameter. Nobody can hear each other speak. Command Person **(Offensive::User) **T: Person D: 1 round R: Hearing Target saves (with penalty equal to [Dice]) or must obey a 1-word command you give. If you invest at least 4 dice, the command must be obeyed for 1d3+1 rounds instead. Command AI (Offensive::AI) T: AI D: [Dice] minutes R: Hearing As Command Person, but specifically for AI. Comprehend Language **(Utility::User::Augments:Head) **T: Self D: [Dice] hrs R: Self The Ware loops language data back and forth between your Deck and frontal cortex.

Confession (Utility::User::Augments:Head) T: Person D: Instant R: 5’ This ware monitors a Target’s vitals and prepares to inflict pain should it detect a lie. Target must answer a question you give truthfully, or they take [Sum] damage. Confusion (Offensive::User::Augments:Head) T: Person D: [Dice] rounds R: 60’ Target saves or is confused for the duration. On their turn, they roll 1d4; on (1), they act normally; on (2), they attack themselves with whatever is on hand; on (3) they attack the nearest creature, friend or foe; on (4) they do nothing but babble incoherently.

Invest 3 [Dice] to instead target an AI and convince it you are an admin level user.

Darkness (Utility::Devices) T: Area D: Concentration R: [Sum]x10’ Disables light sources within the area diameter.

Due to the nature of grenades, this should be used before the grenade is deployed. Digital Fists (Offensive::User::AI) T: Self D: [Dice] minutes R: Self Executing the ware causes the cyberdeck to access and translate signals from the posterior parietal cortex. Effectively, for the duration, you can punch AI for d4 damage (d6 if 3 dice are invested, and d8 if 5 are invested). Digital Knock (Utility::Device) T: Lock D: Instant R: Touch Instantly opens any electronic lock. Can counter a Digital Lock ware if an equivalent number of spell dice are invested. (A Console Jockey can tell how many dice are invested in a digital lock by examining it.) Digital Lock (Utility::Device::Lock) T: Lock D: Permanent R: Connected Connected to an electronic lock to shut down all functions. Only a _Knock _warez with an equal or greater number of spell dice can open the lock thereafter; no key/card/scan can open it.

Explode Device (Offensive::Device) **T: Area D: Instant R: 60’ ** All broken devices in a radius of 60’ around the Jockey explode, dealing [Sum] damage to victims within 10’. Feedback (Offensive::Device) T: Device D: Instant R: 25’ Generates feedback in the device. The device must save or take [Dice] damage to durability. Force Mutation (Offensive::User::Augments) T: Person D: Permanent R: 30’ The Target’s augments begin bleeding energy into the surrounding flesh, corrupting DNA in the Target’s cells. Target Saves or gains a random mutation. You roll one mutation per [Dice] and choose which one to inflict. Generate Noise (Defense::AI) T: Area D: 10 minutes R: 20’ Your deck begins to spew garbage signals within a radius around you, making it look like there are a multitude of devices within the area, requiring [Sum]/2 rounds to sort through to find you. Basically, it creates “rough terrain” for AI in cyberspace. GlobalQuery (Utility::Device) T: Self D: Instant R: Self Through accessing various backdoors of common public record databases, the user may ask [Dice] yes/no questions. If [Sum] is 10+, the user may ask any question using [Dice] words.

Illusory Double (Defensive::User) T: Area D: [Dice] minutes R: 50’ The ware forces everyone within range to Save or have their augments overwhelmed with an illusory duplicate of you, which acts as you direct (but can’t actually interact with anything). Imaginary Terrain (Utility::Area::Augments) T: Area D: [Dice] hours R: [Dice]x100’ Surrounding devices overwhelm visual augments to force a specified area of terrain, up to 100 sq.ft. per [Dice], to appear to be a different type of terrain. Fine details are not possible. Inflict Wounds (Offensive::User) T: Person D: Instant R: 30’ Causes feedback in the target’s augments, which is rather painful. Target Saves or takes [Sum] damage.

However, there is a [Dice]-in-6 chance the program will hide you well enough for ICE to ignore you. Invisibility (Defensive::User::Devices) T: Person D: [Dice] minutes R: 10’ Target is invisible to visual devices and augments. Unless 4 or more dice are invested, the invisibility ends as soon as the target attacks. Firewall (Defensive::User::Device) T: Self D: [Dice] minutes R: Self An advanced firewall is executed on your Deck, giving you a +2 Save vs Hack; if at least 3 dice are invested, it bestows +4 Save; if at least 5 are invested, +6 Save. Jammer (Defensive::Area::Device) T: Area D: Focus R: Self The field emanates from you in a radius of [Sum] x 10’. Within this field all signals are countered. Attempting to use another Ware ends this one. Jury Rig (Utility::Device) T: Device D: Instant R: Connected Communicates with the Device’s daemons and attempts to find a work around for the damage done to the device, though at a price. Temporarily makes the target device operational for [Sum] rounds before breaking completely. Magic Jar (Utility::User) T: Person D: [Dice] days R: 60’ You need a separate drive of sufficient size (2.5 petabytes). The target saves, or their consciousness is shunted onto the drive, your consciousness is transported into their body, and your body becomes a useless husk. When the spell expires, everyone’s consciousness goes back to its proper place. Can’t affect creatures with HD greater than [Dice]. Memory Lapse (Offensive::User) T: Person D: Instant R: 30’ Target forgets everything that happened in the last [Dice] rounds. Mirror Images (Defense::User::Augment::Visual) T: Area D: [Dice] minutes R: 60’ Forces all visual equipment/augments within range to see [Dice] duplicates of you, which overlap with you and confuse attackers. Any time you’re attacked, the attack has an equal chance to hit you or any of your images. If an image is hit, it is destroyed. Movement (Defensive::User::Augments) T: Person D: [Dice] minutes R: Touch Target is immune to any effect that restricts movement of arm or leg augments for the duration, unless the effect has more dice invested than were used in this spell. Paranoia (Offensive::User::Augments) T: Person D: [Dice] rounds R: 120’ Causes the target’s augments to begin whining in infrasound.

Rage (Offensive::User) T: Person D: [Dice] rounds R: Touch Target flies into a rage (unwilling targets can save). They add +[Dice] to all attack and damage rolls for the duration, and must make a melee attack each round - if no other targets are available, they must attack themselves. Recover Log (Utility::Device) T: Device D: [Dice] real minutes R: Connected You temporarily reactivate the daemons in a broken device and are able to query its memory. May know how it broke if the event was logged in time. Share Senses (Utility::User::Augments) T: Person(s) D: [Dice] minutes R: 10’ You and the target within range can freely exchange sensory information for the duration - i.e. they can see through your eyes, feel what you touch, smell what you smell, etc; and vice-versa. Once the ware is executed, the range is network wide. Sign Post (Utility::Area) T: Area D: [Dice] days R: 10’ The user is able to leave a [Sum] length message within the cloud, bound to their current location. This message is viewable by all. Note, this is different from Message Boards or AR advertisements, as those require a dedicated device. This steals a bit of space from surrounding devices to avoid the need of a hosting device. Silence (Utility::Area) T: Area D: [Dice] minutes R: 50’ radius No sound can be detected by audio sensors or augments within the radius. Sleep (Utility::Device) T: Device R: 50’ D: 5*[Dice] turns Puts a device into sleep mode. Slow (Offensive::User::Augments::Legs) T: Slow D: [Dice] rounds R: 120’ Target moves at half speed for the duration. Slumber (Offensive::User) T: Person(s) D: Instant R: 60’ Up to [Sum] HD of creatures in the radius save or fall asleep. Static Wall (Defensive::Area) T: Area D: 30 minutes R: 50’ Generates a solid wall of static in cyberspace. Moving through the space in meatspace causes devices to reboot in [Dice] rounds. AIs take [Sum] damage. Telepathic Link (Utility::User) T: Person(s) D: [Dice] hours R: 10’ Link up to [Dice] + 1 willing creatures to one another; they can communicate telepathically over any distance, so long as they’re on the same network. You can lock the dice to make the effect permanent. Once the ware is executed, the range is network wide. Virus Scan (Utility::Device) T: Device D: 10 minutes R: Connected Detects whether the current device has a virus or other malicious code (like a DataBomb). Has a [Dice]-in-6 chance of finding any dangerous code present.  "

Tips Appreciated   Templates Stepping Razor  Stepping Razor You’re the Hero; the Protagonist; World’s Greatest Swordsman. Or maybe you’re the Razor Girl; nerves set to overdrive with fingers full of blades waiting to be used. Whoever you are, you’re a student in the nearly lost art of Ass Kicking, always on the lookout to fight someone bigger and badder than you, until you prove yourself a master. You gain +1 HP for every Stepping Razor template you possess. Starting Gear: Leather_Jacket(light, 2), Katana (mm, d8, 0, Weeb) ×2, Uzi (mr, 1d8, 5, One_Handed) Starting Skills: [1] - Stepping Razor, [2] - Soldier, [3] - Gang Tactics A. Combat Expert, +1 Attack B. Trophy C. Signature Weapon, +1 Attack D. Armed Shield, Unstoppable Combat Expert You gain +2 to Combat Maneuver rolls. Further, if you get exactly the number you need during an attack roll, make an opposed attribute check as you would during a Combat Maneuver. On a success, you make a free Combat Maneuver. Trophy You collect trophies from high status opponents you defeat; be it a hachimaki of a rival bosozoku leader or a scrap of cloth barring a Corporate logo taken from a former security guard Captain - as long as it is possible for someone to identify and realize that they associate with the trophy. You gain a +1 Attack against those sorts of people. These bonuses stack, though after a while the bosozoku should run out of people. The trophies also make negotiations with that group more difficult. Signature Weapon Choose a weapon you’ve used before. You gain +2 to Attack when using that weapon. Armed Shield On a successful Grapple Maneuver against a target with a ranged weapon, you may make a free attack action against any other target, at a -2 attack modifier, using the grappled target’s weapon. Additionally, any attack made against you while the grapple is held, gets redirected to the grappled target. Unstoppable When you fell an opponent down to 0HP with an attack, you gain a free attack action with the same weapon.  "

Tips Appreciated   Computer Things Hacking  Hacking for Beginners Do you know anything about hackers? Can you jam with the console cowboys in cyberspace? Never experienced the New Wave? Next Wave? Dream Wave? OR Cyberpunk? Have you even read Neuromancer? Listen, ignore 12 year old Julia Stiles. Here’s what you are going to need to know: Anyone with a pair of fingerless gloves and access to a device with an interface can hack. If you want it to be useful, it should also be connected to a relevant network. You can avoid the following mess if you’ve got the correct username/password combination for the terminal. Hackers typically trade usernames/passwords as a sort of second hand currency. Find someone who claims to have what you need, then pay their price. Or do the favor they need. The rules (which were stolen from Warren, who stole them from Ava, who stole them from Telcanter) are rather simple: Select the correct hacking actions - composed of Crack, Hack, and Smack - in order. Each terminal requires all three actions, and no action is repeated. Crack is the brute forcing to discover passwords. Hack is console commands jammed in where they shouldn’t be. Smack is exactly what it sounds like: You haul off and smack the system. Should the Hacker select a wrong action, they’ll be met with an error message. Should a wrong action be selected again, the terminal locks down and becomes unusable. Depending on the level of devices security rating (1-4; assume 1 if not stated) you may be required to repeat the process. If you insist on hacking while in combat, each guess takes a turn and requires your full attention. Leaving the terminal restarts the process and may trigger security. Before you begin Hacking, you’re allowed an Intelligence test: On a Success you eliminate one option for the first action as incorrect. Succeeding by 5 or more reveals the first correct action. Critical success and you immediately gain access On a Failure you gain no insight or advantage to the situation. On Critical Failure, the terminal locks immediately. Now, mind you, just because you’ve hacked a device connected to a network doesn’t mean you’ll be able to make it do anything you want. A door access panel isn’t going to be able to control local cameras. It’s going to open, close, lock, and unlock the door. The console in the security room, however, will be able to control both. It’ll also have a higher security rating and pesky guards who will take offense to you being there. Making a device do what it shouldn’t is what Warez are for. So What Can You Do? There are a few generic actions you can perform, though as said, not all of them will be applicable all the time. Performing them takes about a turn, besides Upload and Download, which are variable based on size of data be transferred Download - You move queried information from the local drive to your portable that you’ve inserted. Query - Ask a question and get an answer to the best of the system’s knowledge. Sabotage - You out right break it, causing an alarm. Suppression - You turn a specified system off for as long as you are at the terminal. Upload - You transfer data from a connected portable drive to the local drive of the system. Use - You use the system as it was intended. Leaving the terminal at this point causes it to continuously run the last command given.  "

Tips Appreciated   Character Generation Now that the brass tacks are out of the way, it’s time to get to making a character. It’s fairly easy and quick, done through the following steps: Roll your stats. 4d4 in order. Roll for your Failed Career. Gain the Failed Career as a skill, and the listed items. Choose your first Template. Gain the A abilities, skill, and listed items. Take another skill of your choosing. Gain the starting items below. Roll your starting cash (1d3 x ₽1000) and purchase additional gear from the Gear section. Pocket any extra cash. Starting Items Starting players are assumed to have the following, in conjunction with other Character Generated items: Commlink Credit Chip 3 clips of ammo for starting weapons Lower class living space Obviously, the last one doesn’t take up inventory space. Leveling Up Leveling up is based on the sort of jobs you do, the number of jobs you do, and the Street Cred generated from doing such jobs. Enough Street Cred and you’ll find yourself in a tougher world, doing harder jobs. You got this though. When you earn a certain amount of Street Cred (detailed on the chart) you gain a level. Whenever a character levels, increase their HP, Attack, and Save based on their new level, per the chart. Additionally, a player may increase a stat of their choosing. Simply declare the stat and roll 3d6. If the result is over, increase the stat by 1. Level HP Attack Save Cred 1 Con - 4 11 6 0 2 Con - 2 12 7 500 3 Con - 8 1000 4 Con +2 13 9 1500 5 +1 Assist - 10 2500 6 +1 Assist 14 11 3500 7 +1 Assist - 12 4500 8 +1 Assist 15 13 6000 9 +1 Assist - 14 7500 10 +1 Assist - 15 9000 +1 +1 Assist - - +2000  Armor and Weapon Proficiencies In a world where products are made to support the lowest common denominator, armor sets and weapons come with detailed instruction manuals. Anyone can use any armor or weapon.  "

Tips Appreciated   Computer Things Jockeying  Jockeying Ascension and Fall (repeated) How does one describe becoming a god? The expansion of consciousness as the trodes slip on, feeding additional sensory data straight into the brain, bypassing the crude, unreliable, bioorganic sensory organs. Optic nerves buzzing in electric voodoo as the seen physical realm is mixed with the digital signals being jammed straight into the biological neural network. A constellation of information nodes, clouds of ones and zeros, the Unknown being replaced with the Known, a True Language of the Birds. Conceptualization IS Being. The heart races, the breath quickens, though the meat is quickly forgotten. The prison built by the Demiurge is Finally Escaped. The Redemption of Sophia. Consciousness melding with One to become All. And then, the trodes come off. And once again you find yourself, bound by form. Knowing trapped behind the slow process of Learning. Once again you are a servant to the cruel flesh, and its tyrannical needs. Water, food, breath - and then expulsion as it uses up resources given, and moves on to the next, ever consuming. Ruled by chemical reactions and addictions. This can be rather upsetting and disorienting to new Console Jockeys. Old Jockeys are usually jaded, but no less longing to return to the True Freedom. Burnt out Jockeys whisper tales of runs past, offering tips and hard earned wisdom - Digital Bodhisattvas, cut off from their rewards this go around. Jockeying Basics Warezs are kept on individual Cassettes until loaded into your data storage of the CyberDeck. You get one cache slot per Hacker template that can hold a single ware. Warez are loaded from storage to cache, and take about 10 minutes to transfer between the two. You get one processing die (d6) per level that can be used to execute a ware in cache. These are refreshed by a night’s worth of defragmenting. You execute Warez by allocating your processing die to a ware in cache and then rolling them. The more dice, the more effective the ware execution. Each die you invest has a 50% chance of returning (on a 1-3) into your processing pool. You do these on your CyberDeck. Warez These aren’t your publically available JWPce, these are experimental military grade software designed specifically for cyberwarfare. Low intelligence AI generated to perform a very specific purpose. Cassettes These are high capacity analog magnetic tape that store the ones and zeros of a military grade ware. Taking the time to transfer the ware onto your CyberDeck provides you with an empty cassette that can be reused. You can run directly from the cassette, skipping cache and providing a free processing die, however this destroys the cassette in the process. Military security feature. You may allocate additional processing dice to this process if you wish. CyberDeck This is your custom built, homemade supercomputer. It takes up two Inventory slots, and requires two hands to use. Initial internal storage is enough space for 10 Warez, or significant files. Faults and Snowcrashes Because of the experimental nature of it all, sometimes you encounter system errors. Faults are relatively minor errors and occur when the processing die produces doubles. Snowcrashes occur when triples are rolled, and are horrible. Don’t roll triples. Or quads. Based on the digit rolled, consult the below tables: Faults Resource hog - Dice only return to your pool on a 1-2 for 24 hours. Ctrl+Alt+Del - Cannot execute any Warez for 1d6 rounds while the tasks restart. Static Arc - Take 1d6 damage Zombie process - An unterminated process is taking up a processor. Lose one processing die for 24 hours. Feedback - Blinding patterns overwhelm your AR interface. Blind for 1d6 rounds. Security Alert - Network security is aware of your presence. Snowcrash Advanced Alert - Network security is aware of you AND your exact location. Ah, shit - …AND your personal identification information. Visual Cortex Feedback - Piercing light burns out your eyes. Blind permanently. Power Surge - A power overload destroys your CyberDeck. It’ll take the better part of a week, and the proper parts, to build a new one. Bio-Short Out- Part of your brain has been altered by the feedback. Roll 1d6 to determine body location. It is now Disabled. Prison of Your Own Flesh - A feedback error causes you to hallucinate for 48 hours straight. As it dies down, you find yourself unable to return to your deck, the horrors you saw scaring you off it again and again. Quads The feedback is too much for your central cortex to handle. Your brain is erased like an old floppy disc exposed to magnets. Intelligence drops to 0 as you become Brain Dead. You’re effectively Dead. Modifications As stated, your CyberDeck is custom built by you. Should you manage to get your hands on another Hacker’s undestroyed deck, and live long enough to keep it, you can dismantle the thing and add parts to yours, improving it. Modifications take about a week to integrate. Roll 1d12 to see what you can scavenge: AR Jack - Allow an additional person to view your AR Cache Memory - +1 to Cache slot Cassette Slot - Gain an extra Cassette Slot Intrusion Detection Neural Network - CyberDeck gains +2 to Saves I/O Board - Useful in replacing your burnt out I/O board Larger Drive - +2 to Internal storage Motherboard - Useful in replacing your burnt out Motherboard Porn Stash - +1 Android Porn file Processor Core - +1 Processing Die Stored Ware - +1 random ware Username/Password - +1 Username and Password file Virtual Agent - +1 Virtual Agent  "

Tips Appreciated   Death and Dismemberment So, you’ve decided to get shot. Not the choice I would have made, but here we are. Well, you are. Good luck. Whenever you take Lethal damage (damage suffered below 0), you’re gonna roll on the table below. On the left is the result of the severity roll, the top is the location hit or the element used. You gain the listed injury, as well as all the Injuries above it. The table can’t account for everything, so interpret it logically. Augments in affected locations are broken until repaired. Hit Location = d6 Severity = 1d12 + Lethal Damage + # of current Injuries Non-Lethal Damage (stun gun, black jack, etc) results in Knocked Out for X round Damage and Injuries Some injuries listed aren’t on the table, but can be acquired through other means, GM choice, or deliberate actions. Damage types are also here, because I can’t think of a better place. Acid: A chemical substance that dissolves some alkalis, metals and flesh. Environmentally, does 1d6 damage to the character and 1 Endurance point (see Gear section) to any equipment when entering or starting your turn in it, unless protected. Blind: Cannot see. -8 to Attack and Defence. Automatically hit by area-of-effect attacks. Permanent. Bleeding Out: You take 1d4 damage every turn until healed (requiring First Aid Kit). Blood Loss: Your permanent HP is reduced by 1 for every level you possess. Burned/Frozen: Save. On success, gain an Interesting Scar. On failure roll below: Lose an arm Lose both arms Lose a leg Lose both legs Lose an eye Lose both legs, arms, and eyes. Blind. \ Concussed: Initiative is reduced to 4. Cracked Ribs: Maximum health is reduced by 4 (to a minimum of 1). Cryo: Temperatures around -200°C. Sustained contact by living organics is not advisable. Even ethanol freezes at this point. Environmentally, does 1d6 damage to the character and freezes any liquid when entering or starting your turn in it, unless protected. Damage Reduction: Bestowed by some of the better armors. Reduces the damage taken by the noted amount. Deaf: Cannot hear. If ambushed, always act last. Permanent. Disabled: The limb becomes unusable. A disabled arm cannot hold things, dropping anything that was in that hand. A disabled leg can’t be walked on without significant assistance, cutting your movement in half. Electric: The forgotten hazard powering our world. High-amperage electricity as one would find in a utility line or lightning strike. Environmentally, does 1d6 damage to the character, and 1 Endurance point to equipment, when entering or starting your turn in it, unless protected. Being in water doubles damage, as does holding metal. Fatal Wound: You have 3 rounds to get rid of ALL your Fatal Wounds, or you die. You have a 1-in-6 chance of removing a Fatal Wound from yourself at the end of each round. An adjacent ally can attempt to remove a Fatal Wound by spending a standard action doctoring you (requiring a First Aid Kit), and then rolling under half their Intelligence score - unless they have a useful skill. You cannot take conscious or deliberate actions. Feel free to scream and flail. Oldest Fatal Wounds are removed first. Fatigue: Each point of Fatigue damage takes up 1 Inventory slot (see below). This can be healed through a Good Night’s rest. Fire: The phenomena of combustion manifested through heat, light, and flame. Tends to ignite flammable things. Environmentally, does 1d6 damage when entering or starting your turn in it. Requires Dexterity test or catch fire for an additional 1d6 damage per round until extinguished. Fried: Save. If passed, gain an Interesting Scar. If failed, roll below: Deaf. Lose an eye. -1 to range attacks. Lose both eyes. Blind. Nervous system damaged. Permanently lose 1 from a random stat. Palsied. Permanent -2 to Attack and Defence. Lose an arm and both eyes. Blind. Mangled: Save. If passed, gain an Interesting Scar. If failed, lose a limb. Mutation: Roll on the mutation table, gain that mutation. Non-lethal: For when you don’t want to kill a bastard, but you want them to stop. Examples include fists and low amperage/high voltage electricity (stun gun). Poison: A chemical that causes injury or death to cells, tissue, organs, or DNA. Called a Toxin if generated by organic source, and a Venom if delivered through injection. Damage by specific poison. Radiation: Damage done by radiation does not affect current HP, rather the damage is done to maximum HP. Environmentally, does 1d6 damage when moving into or starting in it. Scorched/Frostbite: Cannot wear armor. Difficulty gripping and climbing. Sickened: You are unable to keep the majority of your food and medicine down. Healing from First Aid or Good Night’s Rest (see below) is halved. Skull Cracked: Save. If passed, gain an Interesting Scar. If fail, roll below: Permanently lose 1 Intelligence Permanently lose 1 Wisdom Permanently lose 1 Charisma Blurred vision. Permanently -2 to Attack and Defense. Damage to the Broca’s and Wernicke’s areas. Lose the ability to speak coherently. Coma. Unconscious. Save means recovery in 1d6 days. Failure means 1d100 days. Winded: Automatically fail Initiative tests until you rest. Wracked: Save. If passed, gain an Interesting Scar. If failed, roll below: Permanently lose 1 from a random stat. Permanently lose 1 from all stats. Lose a limb and an eye. -1 to range attacks. Lose 2 from Strength and Constitution. Enfeebled. Take double damage from additional ingested poisons. Heart pain. Cannot run. Are some of these a little brutal? Maybe. But this is also a world of body augments, so if your buddies can drag you off and you can come up with the cash, most are merely a nuisance. Interesting Scars Twisted marks of flesh revealing a violent past. It provides a +2 bonus to Charisma while interacting with people who appreciate that sort of thing.  "

Tips Appreciated   Inventory Drones  Drones Drones are semi-autonomous devices that come in various sizes and are made for various purposes. From maglev mounted cameras to a weapons platform mounted on Boston Dynamics’ cheetah, each brings a unique edge to a mission. Controlling a drone takes a full round action to issue a command to a single drone, unless one has a Drone Control Unit. Then, you’re able to control a single drone per Control Unit as a free action. Drones have three modes of operation: defense, offense, and operation. Defense mode provides +1 to the operator’s Defense. Offense mode provides +1 to the operator’s Attack. Operation mode is based on the function of the drone: camera drones will transmit images, echo drones will retransmit signals, autopets will purr and be cute. If a drone isn’t outfitted to perform a mode, it will do so at the expense of itself - camera drones will place themselves between the operator and bullets as best they can in Defense mode, or just smack themselves into a target as hard as they can in Attack mode. Both of these cause damage to the drone. Should a drone be caught outside of combat on its own (not assisting the operator and therefore not following the follower/mercenary rules as vaguely implied above) the base stats are Attack/Defense 10, mobility 12 (if not immobile), with Stealth 5. Stats Drones have four pieces of information associated with them: HP: This is the factory set health points of the drone. Size: This is the size of the drone. Mobility: This details how the drone gets around, if it does. Special: This basically tells the function of the drone. Size - Drones are available in one of four sizes (small, medium, large, and heavy) before they technically become vehicles and things start getting weird. Small drones take up 1 inventory space. Medium drones take up 3. Large drones require equipment to move. Heavy drones typically only move under their own means. Health Points (HP) - Available in 4, 6, 8, and 10 HP. Drones do not naturally heal by themselves and require a mechanic to repair. Once at 0 HP the drone is broken and unusable until repaired. HP is typically tied to Size, however some are potentially more fragile in their constructions. Mobility - This describes how the drone moves. Aquatic means it only operates on water Flight means it flies. Most popular selection. Immobile drones do not move. Treads move through soft terrain with ease. Walkers have legs. For walking. Wheels operate best on solid, flat surfaces. Special - This is basically everything else needed to fully describe the functions and operations of the drone. List of Drones Presented is a list of publicly available market drones. For more exotic and spicy drones, you’ll need to steal or find a source in game. Aerial Guardian (₽15000) An flying drone someone mounted a shield to Size: Large HP: 8 Mobility: Flight Special: Provides +2 in Defense mode Domestic Companion (₽4000) Available in Cat, Dog, Fox, and Mini Ostrich forms Size: Medium HP: 6 Mobility: Walker Special: Includes air filter, vacuum, and digital assistant features. HOA Patroller (₽10000) A lighter version than what the privatized police “services” use to monitor neighborhoods Size: Large HP: 8 Mobility: Flight Special: Patrols a designated area, sweeping the location with alternating visual augments, and sends a report to the controller, rather than the disabled gun ports. Man-Bot (₽20000) _A robot mimicking human form. Typically used by Capitalists to replace skilled workers. _ Size: Large HP: 8 Mobility: Walker Special: Can be programmed for various menial tasks. Has two manipulators and 5 inventory slots. Mule (₽20000) Why carry things when the robot can do it? Size: Heavy HP: 10 Mobility: Treads/Wheels Special: Provides 20 inventory slots for gear or people. A person takes up 10 slots. Encumbrance inflicts an equal amount of points per round. Spotlight (Mk 1) (₽5000) _It’s basically a set of rotors attached to a flashlight. _ Size: Medium HP: 6 Mobility: Flight Special: Usable to illuminate a target from the air. Spotlight (Mk 2) (₽15000) Bigger flashlight, bigger area covered Size: Heavy HP: 10 Mobility: Flight Special: Usable to illuminate an area from the air. Spyder (₽1500) Take a camera, give it spider legs, and get to spying Size: Small HP: 4 Mobility: Walker Special: Remote broadcasting of a video signal to the coupled receiver. VISION 70 (₽15000) _Used by police forces to intimidate civilians during unjustified stops. Liberated by neighborhood kids. _ Size: Large HP: 8 Mobility: Walker Special: The mounted rifle provides +2 in Attack mode. Warning Shot (₽3000) A tiny turret used for home defense Size: Small HP: 4 Mobility: Immobile Special: No Defense mode. Will automatically attack (1d6) any unauthorized target within 30 feet. Ysalamiri (₽5000) It’s basically a RC car with a signal jammer duct taped to it. A neighborhood kid invention. Size: Medium HP: 6 Mobility: Wheels Special: Jams all signals within 30’.

Tips Appreciated   Templates These are, basically, what other systems refer to as “classes.” Except you only get four of them at most, can mix and match, and don’t have to take several empty levels worth to get to a feature. Templates must be taken in alphabetical order , within their same group. If taking a different template group, the next template starts again at A. For example: Face A must be taken before Face B. If taking Hacker next level, the player must take Hacker A. Taking Face again next level allows for Face C. The template taken at level 1 gives the character the listed Starting Equipment and a randomly selected starting skill. As said, only the first four levels provide templates and related abilities. Gaining abilities and growing past level four is done through either purchasing Augmentations to jam into your body, or surviving strange situations. The later is referred to as Delta (𝚫) Templates - should that information ever needed. There are two types of templates presented here: Basic and Eclectic. Basic Templates These are templates designed to use the system in the usual manner, with Base Mechanics working as written. Perfect for Beginners and Experienced players alike. Augmented Console Jockey Face Fixer Stepping Razor Tweeker Eclectic Templates These are templates with at least a little weirdness to them. Certain attributes may affect different abilities, Base Mechanics may work a little off kilter, or entirely new mechanics might be provided.

Tips Appreciated   Definitions Alright, if I don’t define this list of very similar sounding, ever so slightly related words upfront, I’m going to confuse myself, and maybe you. There’s a strong chance in editing this document I’ve used the following terms interchangeably. Console Jockey - A Combat Programmer who uses a CyberDeck to perform illicit activities using Warez. CyberDeck - Homemade, military grade supercomputer compacted down into a small square meter. CyberSpace - The realm digital. Most often experienced in modern day through the usage of Augmented Reality, which blends Cyber and Meatspace. Hacking - Using social exploits and knowledge of digital exploits to access data and systems uninvited. Requires the Hacker’s full attention and is not advisable during combat operations. Jocking - The act a Console Jockey performs when executing Warez. Much like the job it’s named after, it has a very high risk of debilitating or life-threatening injuries. Programming - Writing and compiling programs. Can only be done during down time between missions. Programs - Mostly called Apps nowadays. These are compiled code used to perform legitimate operations on a computer Warez - Modern day WMDs that force devices to operate in potentially unexpected ways, usually against the operator’s will. Specifically made to be used in combat. CyberSpace To get straight to the point, the cyberspace of 20XX is heavily dependent on meatspace. The Internet of Things distributed system makes up just about every object now in the human sphere. Physical objects are no longer disconnected from the virtual world, as they now contain some form of processing capability, rebroadcasting Internet services and allowing for remote and Augment Reality based control. From the gun at your side communicating with your cybereye to provide a crosshair, to the bag of salted seaweed chips advertising their price (and reporting your browsing/ purchasing habits) - everything is connected in the IoT. Jocking, technically, takes place between meatspace and AR - before the digital displays flood your vision, IoT broadcasting points appear as points of light. People appear as moving constellations of personal networks. Single devices burn as singularities. Table of contents Hacking Programmming Jockeying Warez   "

Cyberpunk 2020’s got too much crunch, some of the “rules lite” stuff doesn’t have enough. Or maybe the server you were using to illegal view Cyberpunk core books was hit by a missle. Either way, I present you this cobbled together mess. Based on the GLoG system by Arnold K, Some Weird Sin (formerly “CyberGLoG”) is a cyberpunk mod/hack/skin seeking to provide the simplified rules of the GLoG to a Cyberpunk setting. I then foul that up by adding in just on more subsystem. But it’s functional, and what I use. You can use it now, without having to wait for the slow production of me putting out a PDF. Or digging through the blog. Some Weird Sin is a game where players take on the roles of down on their luck mercenaries in a world overrun with libertarians, jaded to violence, and fetishizing technology. It’s like if your shitty boomer uncle who can’t open a PDF had a robot arm, but for the whole world. Will you look to make it a better place? Or just do enough to survive?

Tips Appreciated   Templates Investigator  Investigator Adapted from Rise Up Comus’s Loremaster Sure, sure, anyone can investigate, but you Investigate. Whether you do it to report the Truth, or to keep the lights on in your Detective Agency, well, that’s up to you. Be it natural intuition or a probability computer jammed into your head and hosting a minor AI, well, also up to you. Starting Equipment: Trenchcoat(medium, 4, Conceal), Glock_19 (lr, d6, 6), Notepad PDA Starting Skill: 1) Underworld, 2) Recent News 3) Corporate Affairs A. d4 Investigation Die, 2 Rhetorics B. d6 Investigation Die, 4 Rhetorics C. d8 Investigation Die, 6 Rhetorics D. d10 Investigation Die, 8 Rhetorics, Just One More Thing… Investigation Die Roll your Investigation die each time you call upon a Rhetorics. Should the dice roll a 1-2, then the die is downgraded to the next lower die in the chain. Should it become downgraded on a d4, then you have grown too exhausted to continue your deductive reasoning. A night’s sleep will reset the Investigation Die to its normal value. d4<d6<d8<d10 Rhetorics Rhetorics represent areas of rhetorical reasoning used in finding the crux of the matter. Each time you use a Rhetoric, roll an Investigation Die to test the strain on your mental faculties. A list and explanation of Rhetorics follows: How If you are talking to an NPC about a subject for at least 3 minutes, you may ask the GM “How do they feel about [the subject]?” The GM will answer based on one of the following phrase: They hate it They’re angry at it. They’re afraid of it. They love it. They’re sad about it. They’re surprised by it. They have no strong feelings. Language You can translate almost any language, including encoded, given enough time. A Turn for a single inscription or down time for an entire book or meaningful conversation with someone whom you share no language with. Keep a list of languages you’ve translated. After translating the same language three times, you may add it to your Skills. This is basically what Daniel Jackson does. Lies After speaking with a person for at least 3 minutes, you may ask the GM “Are they lying?” Barring any countering obfuscation, the GM will tell you if they are lying, but not what the lie was. Mind Palace You have perfect recall. With a few minutes of concentration (1d10) you may ask the GM to remind you of anything you have seen or heard. Omission After speaking with an NPC for at least 3 minutes, you may ask the GM “What did they omit?” The answer will be vague by nature, but if the person was purposefully omitting something, the GM will tell you. Vice After speaking with a person for at least 3 minutes, you may ask the GM “What is their vice?” What You’re able to ask the GM “What is this?” The GM will give you a name and a one sentence explanation. When After carefully examining a scene, you may ask the GM “When did this happen?” The GM will tell you. Where When you hear the name of a location, you may ask the GM “Where is that?” They will place it on the map for you. Who After carefully observing a scene, you may ask the GM “Who is responsible for this?” If the answer is concealed, the GM gives you one meaningful clue. If the answer is not concealed and it is possible that you could know, they will tell you. Why After carefully observing a scene, you may ask the GM “Why was this done?” If the answer is concealed, you’ll receive one meaningful clue. If it is not, and it is possible you could know, the GM will tell you. Just One More Thing… Once per adventure, if you have motive and means, you may ask a target a question (starting with “Just one more thing”) stating both and automatically force a confession. ##  "

Tips Appreciated   Combat Switch to Combat Rounds when there’s a chance a fight will break out. Combat Rounds are roughly 3 seconds, a Moment. I’ve never seen this matter, but it might. If someone, or someones, attacks by surprise, they get to act before Initiatives are rolled for a round. Unless the targets being ambushed have an ability to not be surprised, then they can attempt to act on this round, as normal, per the wording of their ability. Once all ambushers have acted, Initiatives are rolled normally. Initiative Each round of combat, PC’s must roll their Wisdom. Success means they act before the enemies. Failure means they act after their enemies. PCs may act in any order they wish as, technically, they’re acting simultaneously. Some unusual enemies may act out of order, multiple times, or even impose a penalty to Pc’s Wisdom. Action Economy On their turn, PCs or enemies may do ONE of the following, plus move about 60’: Make an Attack against a target Run about 60’ Activate Gear Reload a weapon Attempt a Combat Maneuver Attempt to remove a Fatal Wound from a target Talking, dropping an item, or retrieving one from their Quick Inventory can all be done freely, even on other’s turns. Spending a Help Point may also be done, specifically, on other people’s turn (See Hit Points below). Attacking Roll under Attack, modified by the target’s Defense, to hit. Example: Miguel, a level 3 Street Samurai wielding his family heirloom katanas, tries to hit a Rent-A-Cop in light armor. Miguel’s Attack is 11 plus his Template bonus of 4, or 15. The Rent-A-Cop’s Defense is 12, due to Armor, imposing -2 against Miguel. The Player must therefore roll 13 or below for Miguel to bypass the Armor and do damage. Defense Roll under Defense, modified by the attacker’s Attack, to defend. Example: The Rent-A-Cop, badly wounded but still in the fight, draws his light pistol on Miguel and fires with a 12 Attack. Miguel, in Medium Armor, has a defense of 14. Miguel’s player must roll 12 to successfully Defend. Combat Maneuver Whenever you attempt to shove or trip an opponent in combat, make a contested roll based on the maneuver, using the target’s Attack as penalty. If you succeed, you perform the maneuver and the target takes the condition you’re trying to inflict. If you fail, the target gets an automatic hit against you. Opposed Strength: for shoving and grappling Opposed Dexterity: for tripping and disarming The core rules have Combat Maneuvers split into two rolls. However, in the spirit of combining rolls where possible, they’ve been combined into one. Damage When you fail to Defend, you’re going to take damage. Light Weapons (daggers, pistols) deal 1d6 damage Medium Melee Weapons (clubs, automatic pistols, rifles) deal 1d8 if they take up one hand or 1d10 is wielded two handly. Medium Range Weapons such as automatic pistols deal 1d8, but offer a free hand. Rifles deal 1d10, must be fired with both hands. Heavy Weapons (chainsaws, BFGs) deal 1d12, but take two hands to operate. Hit Points When you take damage, it’s going to affect your Hit Points (HP). Usually negatively. Hit Points represent the injuries you can take before facing serious complications. There are no mechanical effects for being at 0 HP, however any additional damage you take is Lethal Damage, which involves a roll on the Death and Dismemberment table. HP is equal to your Constitution as modified by your level, per the Base Character table. They max out at 20. I insist a Hit Point check can be a thing, I’m just not sure for what yet. Level Hit Points 1 Con - 4 2 Con -2 3 Con 4 Con +2 Past Level 4 you begin to accrue Assists, at a rate of 1 per level. Again, Templates and Augments may adjust this. Assists Assists are assistance inside of combat that allow you to modify an ally’s roll by an amount equal to the number spent, up or down. Much like assisting someone in a Strength check to provide a bonus, only in combat. They are spent on other people’s turns, multiple people can contribute simultaneously, and there is no limit to how many can be spent at once. The only limit is that you must be feasibly able to affect your ally’s action. The Face shouts a warning, and the Street Sam is able to catch an unseen club on his forearm, rather than the back of the head. The Street Sam reaches out her riot shield, stopping a bullet meant for the distracted Hacker. The Tweaker, seeing his Face buddy in a fight he can’t win, gets close to the attacker and starts doing some tweaking shit, distracting the attacker mid-swing. The Tweaker, still tweaking, now shirtless and raving about the Unseen Agents of the Hand, presents a larger source of fear than the Face, allowing the Face to pop off a few successful shots against his previous attacker. If it seems plausible and reasonable, let ‘em be badasses. No blocking bullets when they’re a block away. Assists are renewable with a good night’s rest in a Safe House.  "

Tips Appreciated   Overview CyberGLoG is based on Arnold K.’s “Goblin Laws of Gaming” homebrew system, also known as the GLOG. Original game rules and content can be found at goblinpunch.blogspot.com The following content is meant to be a cyberpunk flavoring of that core rule set, and as such borrows heavily from it, with a few adjustments here and there. Base Character The following describes your character before the application of templates. Level HP Attack Save Cred 1 Con - 4 11 6 0 2 Con - 2 12 7 500 3 Con - 8 1000 4 Con +2 13 9 1500 5 +1 Assist - 10 2500 6 +1 Assist 14 11 3500 7 +1 Assist - 12 4500 8 +1 Assist 15 13 6000 9 +1 Assist - 14 7500 10 +1 Assist - 15 9000 +1 +1 Assist - - +2000  Level A measure of your character’s power. It goes up as you gain XP. At each level you gain an additional template (up to a max of 4) and the accompanying abilities, in addition to the base character listed above. You can also test a single stat of your choosing to see if it improves. To do so, roll 3d6. If it is equal-or-higher than the current stat, it improves by 1. At level 4 a character has access to their full array of abilities, and is considered “fully trained”. Gaining abilities past 4th level is done in one of two ways: Cash - It’s the future of the 80’s where money rules everything. For the right price, you can purchase augments and upgrade your body. Surviving weird shit - Survive a blast from an experimental phase-shifter cannon from a zaibatsu science technician? Well, now you can force your way through solid materials. Alternatively, anytime you gain a new level at 5th or higher, you’ve the option to retire your character in safety - out of the reach of the GM. Characters retired before level 5 may return as macguffins or NPCs, their lives fully susceptible to loss or betrayal. Base Mechanics Almost everything is based on rolling a d20 against a target number. If you roll equal to or under the target number, you succeed (“meeting is beating”). Roll over it, and you’ve failed. 1 is always success, 20 is always failure. “Roll under” and “Test” will be used throughout the text as a short-hand. Situational bonuses and penalties are usually +/- 2 or 4, applied to the target number. Contested checks are also resolved in this manner. The player makes their check with an adjustment based on how far the opponent’s stat is from 10. Examples: Shoving: The PC has Str 11, the Hobo Tweaker has Str 16. The PC needs to roll 5 to succeed, since 11 – 6 = 5. Attacking: The PC has Attack 12, the Heavy Security Guard has Defense 16. The PC needs to roll a 6 or less to succeed, since 12 – 6 = 6. Stats Characters have 6 stats, which serve as vague descriptions of their physical and mental prowess. Strength: Tested when you attempt feats of Strength: Shoving, climbing, forcing open doors, etc. Effects the number of items you can carry. Dexterity: Tested when trying to dodge traps, leap over obstacles, or perform delicate operations under pressure. Half of your Dexterity is the number of “Quick Inventory” items you can have. Constitution: Tested when trying to resist disease, drowning, radiation, and the like. Your hit points are based on your Constitution and level. Intelligence: Tested when asking esoteric questions about the world. Also determines the number of skills you can have. Wisdom: Tested when attempting to discern lies, spot hidden dangers, and to resist mind altering effects. It also determines your initiative. You’ll test initiative every round of combat to see if you act before or after opponents. Charisma: Test to flatter or beguile. While social interaction is done at the table, potential edge cases are determined via Charisma test. It also affects the number of Hirelings you can manage. Other Numbers These are basically sub-stats. Listed are their primary modifiers, however Templates, Augments, and Gear may potentially modify them as well. See these particular sections for more details. Attack: Starts at 11, and increases with level per the chart. Roll under Attack, modified by the target’s Defense, to hit. Defense: Starts at 10, modified by Armor. Light Armor is +2, Medium armor is +4, Heavy Armor is +6. Shields offer +1. Roll under Defense, modified by target’s Attack, to defend. Initiative: Starts at Wisdom and is modified by Templates, Augments, and/or Gear. Written separately here as a quick reference. Movement: Starts at 12. Determines how far you can move (about 60’; 5’ per 1 Movement), and is used in a contested test to safely disengage with an enemy in melee. Affected by Armor (-0 for Light Armor, -2 for Medium Armor, -4 for Heavy Armor) Save: Starts at 5 and increases with Level. If an attack or challenge doesn’t fall neatly, or agreeably, under any other stat or value, roll Save. It represents the character’s luck and ability to spit in the face of Fate. Stealth: Starts at 5 and acts as a penalty to opponents Wisdom to notice you. Affected by Armor (-0/-2/-4), Encumbrance, and environment. Conviction This life you’ve found yourself in is out right dangerous, more so given the world you live in. The lifestyle is often uncomfortable, morally questioning, and did I mention dangerous? No one takes it up without a good reason. All the better to stay a corporate cog, consuming mindless entertainment and corn-based substances. But not for you. You long for something better, something meaningful. You’ve been cursed with Conviction. Not everyone has Conviction, especially these days, but Player Characters always do. A Conviction is your character’s answer to one of these questions: Why did I start this lifestyle? What am I willing to risk my life for? What principles will guide my actions? There are two blank spots on your character sheet for Convictions. You can fill these in whenever you want. Have a clear picture of the character when you start? Fill them in. Not sure about who your character is? Play them for a bit, get the feel of them, and fill it in when their Convictions reveal themself to you. However, you can’t gain or spend Conviction points until you have at least one Conviction. A Conviction might be “Find my brother.” Or “Bring down Marcone.” Shoot, even “Sup, girl?” can be a Conviction. You gain Conviction points whenever following a Conviction gets you into trouble. Or, at least, when following the Conviction is not an optimal strategy, yet you follow it anyway. If you leave a crime boss for the cops instead of putting a bullet in his because you have the Conviction of “Due Process,” knowing full well he can send goons after you from prison, take a Conviction point. You’re doing what you know to be Right, not easy. Conviction Points can be spent to get a bonus on a d20 roll. If the roll is related to a Conviction: +8 If the roll is unrelated to a Conviction: +4 You can only receive the large bonus if the roll is related to your Conviction. If your Conviction is “Find my brother” and the action leads you closer to finding said wayward brother, take a +8. However, if you need some help dealing with an Everglades methgator, you’ll get the +4. Typically, characters can only have 1 point of Conviction at a time. Some Templates may modify this. Skills Skills are just a word that describes something your character knows how to do. If you can convince the GM the skill applies for a test, you take a +2 bonus. You start off with three skills, determined by your Failed Career, your level 1 Template, and 1 of your choosing. These include non-native languages. You may have a total of 3+(Int/4) skills. Skills cannot be used directly in combat.  "

Augments - Some Weird Sin SRD  Augments | Some Weird Sin SRD    Skip to main content Link  Search  Menu  Expand  Document  (external link)  Some Weird Sin SRD  HomeOverviewCombatDeath and DismembermentHealing and IntoxicantsCharacter GenerationFailed Careers TemplatesAugmentedConsole JockeyFaceFixerInvestigatorPeople's ChampionStepping RazorTweekerContacts, Groupies, and Mercenaries InventoryPrice ListArmorWeaponsEquipmentDronesDrugs AugmentsAugment ListAugment PackagesAugment Price List Computer ThingsHackingProgrammmingJockeyingWarezAppendix NCredits This site uses Just the Docs, a documentation theme for Jekyll.    Tips Appreciated   Installation Fully installing Augments requires the purchase of a Replacement part as well as the Upgrade being installed. Additional installations to the same limb can be purchased at the Upgrade cost, without Replacement. You already have it, afterall. Augment effects are stackable. There’s no set limit to how much can be installed to a limb section, save for your cash. There’s no set aesthetic either. You want to jam all the eye augments into a single eye? Fine. Want multiple electronic eyes lining your face? Great! Get weird with it. You’re in a world that fetishizes technology, nothing matters anymore. Purchasing Augments is restricted until level 5, and must be acquired through Augment templates between levels 1-4. Feel free to steal them off of bodies, though. They’re not using them anymore. Replacements These are basic prosthetics that return function to the limb, nothing more. Obvious replacements are clearly cybernetic. Lifelike replacements look like flesh and blood. Reclaiming Should you happen to find yourself with a fresh body with augmentations you’re wanting, reclaiming them is as easy as finding a black clinic and having it harvested and installed. It’s recycling really. They’re not using it. It would be a waste not to. Cyber Sponsoring Want an augment you can’t afford? Well, you’re in luck! Much like the e-readers of old, that display commercials for corporations, there are several options you can take in order to reduce the cost of the augment. Simply agree to some minor advertisement services or non intrusive data collection, and your dreams of owning a piece of cutting edge cyberware can be yours! Prices can only be marked down to 50%. Don’t think you’re being cute. Branded (-10%) - The company’s name and logo are prominently displayed in the augment. It’s not exactly “cool,” now, is it? Expect to be made fun of for it. Treat each piece of branded cyberware as an “interesting scar” but, you know, the opposite. Commercial Break (-25%) - Before you can use the augment, you must sit through a short, 10-second commercial. The augmentation projects a small image into the world, accompanied by an audio advertisement, ensuring everyone around you has to suffer for your cheapness. Pretty awkward for medical augments. Commercial Hologram (-25%) - From time-to-time the augmentation vomits forth a holographic projection three feet above your head, both revealing your location and annoying others with needless products. DRM Protected (-30%) - Usage of the augment is based on a monthly subscription. Failure to pay the subscription results in a DRM shutting down the augment. “Surely a cybernetic arm without super strength is still a fancy prosthetic arm?” Nope. DRM shuts down everything, making it a piece of useless metal hanging off your shoulder. Product Placement (-5%) - Only available if you have eye augmentations. Essentially, this places product advertisements in your field of vision: Beer cans with flamboyant dancing mascots appear on empty desks, high powered sports cars appear in empty parking lots, miniature billboards appear as hanging pictures along walls, etc. Basically, this gives the GM permission to fuck with your vision via visual illusions. Tracking (-50%) - The augment constantly records data about you: location data, shopping data, attention data, any and all data that might be usable for marketing purposes. You didn’t WANT privacy, did you? Table of contents Augment List Augment Packages Augment Price List   "
